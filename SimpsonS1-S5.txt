Ooh! Careful, Homer! There's no time.
We're late.
O little town of Bethlehem O little town of Bethlehem How still we see the elie -Excuse me.
Pardon me.
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
- Hey, Norman, how's it goin'? So you got dragged down here too, huh? - How you doin', Fred? - Sorry.
Excuse me.
- Yeah.
'Scuse me.
Oh! Pardon my galoshes.
Are met in thee tonight Wasn't that wonderful? And now "Santas of many lands," as presented by the entire second grade class.
Oh! Lisa's class.
Frohliche Weihnachten.
That's German for " Merry Christmas.
" In Germany, Santa's servant Ruprecht gives presents to good children and whipping rods to the parents of bad ones.
Merry Kurisumasu.
I am Hotseiosha, a japanese priest who acts like Santa Claus.
I have eyes in the back ofmy head so children better behave when I'm nearby.
Now presenting Lisa Simpson as Tawanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas.
Ooh, it's Lisa! That's ours.
Ah, the fourth grade will now favor us with a melody-- Uh, medley of holiday "flavorites.
" Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Ha ha ha Bells on bobtail ring - Isn't Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like an angel.
Oh, jingle bells Batman smells Robin laid an egg The Batmobile broke its wheel The joker got awa-- Jingle bells Jingle bells Jingle all The fifth grade will now favour us with a scene from Charles, uh, Dickens' A Christmas Carol.
How many grades does this school have? " Dear friends of the Simpson family, "We had some sadness and some gladness this year.
" First, the sadness.
Our little cat Snowball "was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven.
"But we bought a new little cat, Snowball I.
"So I guess life goes on.
"Speaking of life going on, Grandpa's still with us, feisty as ever.
" Maggie is walking by herself, "Lisa got straight A's, and Bart-- "Well, we love Bart.
"The magic of the season has touched us all.
Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet? - " Homer sends his love.
Happy holidays.
- Marge! - The Simpsons.
" - Marge, where's the extension cord? For heaven's sake, Homer.
It's in the utility drawer.
Sorry.
I'm just a big kid.
And I love Christmas so much.
D'oh! All right, children, let me have those letters.
I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole.
Oh, please.
There's only one fat guy that brings us presents, and his name ain't Santa.
Uh-- A pony? Oh, Lisa, you've asked for that for the last three years, and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh.
Can't you take a hint? But I really want a pony, - and I've been really good this year.
- Oh, dear.
Maybe Bart is a little more realistic.
- A tattoo? - A what? Yeah! They're cool, and they last the rest of your life.
you will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
Yeah.
If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your allowance.
- All right! - Homer! - "Yello.
" - Marge, please.
- Who's this? May I please speak to Marge? - This is her sister, isn't it? - Is Marge there? - Who shall I say is calling? - Marge, please.
It's your sister.
Oh! - Hello.
- Hello, Marge.
It's Patty.
Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our sister Christmas Eve.
Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit too.
Somehow I doubt that Homer is excited.
of all the men you could've married, I don't know why you picked one who's always so rude to us.
- Good one, Dad.
Okay, kids, prepare to be dazzled.
Marge, turn on the juice! - What do you think, kids? - Nice try, Dad.
Just hold your horses, son.
Hey, Simpson! - What is it, Flanders? - Do you think this looks okay? Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
- Oh! - Oh, neato! It's too bright.
I oughta-- Flanders.
What a big show-off.
- Kids, wanna go Christmas shopping? - I do! - All right! The mall! - Go get your money.
Tell us, Marge.
Where have you been hiding the Christmas money? Oh, I have my secrets.
Turn around.
- you can look now.
- Ooh! Big jar this year.
Oh, Bart, that's so sweet.
It's the best present a mother could get, and it makes you look so dangerous.
- One " Mother," please.
Wait a minute.
How old are you? - Twenty-one, sir.
- Get in the chair.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Attention, all personnel, please keep working during the following announcement.
And now our boss and friend Mr.
Burns.
Hello.
I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase safety here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer or affecting management payraises.
However, for you semiskilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses.
- Oh, and one more thing.
Merry Christmas! - Oh, thank God for the big jar.
- Where's that Bart? But, Mom, I thought you'd like it.
Yes, Mrs.
Simpson, we can remove your son's tattoo.
It's a simple routine involving lasers.
- Cool! - However, it is rather expensive, and we must insist on a cash payment up front.
- Cash? - Mm-hmm.
Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus.
- Ay, caramba! - Now, whatever you do, don't squirm.
you don't wanna get this sucker near your eye or your groin.
- Ow! Quit it.
Ow! Quit it.
Ow! Quit it.
- Ow! Quit it.
- Hey, what's with this? Ow! Quit it! Used to be a real boss tattoo.
Mom had to spend the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
Huh? It's true! The jar is empty! Oh, my God! We're ruined.
Christmas is canceled.
No presents for anyone! Don't worry, Homer.
We'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus - even further this year.
- Homer? - Oh, yeah.
My Christmas bonus.
How silly of me.
This'll be the best Christmas yet.
The best any family ever had.
Hohoho.
Hohoho.
Hohoho.
Ho ho ho.
Hohoho.
Hmm.
I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer.
- Huh? Oh.
I love you, Marge.
- you tell me that all the time.
Oh, good, because I do love you.
I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus.
I keep asking for it, but-- Marge, um, let me be honest with you.
- Yes? - Well, I would-- I-- I wanna do the Christmas shopping this year.
Uh, sure, okay.
Marge, Marge.
Hmm.
Let'ssee.
Ooh, look! Pantyhose.
Practical and alluring.
A six-pack.
Oh! Only 4.
99.
Ooh! Pads of paper.
I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these.
That just leaves little Maggie.
Oh, look! A little squeak toy.
It says it's for dogs, but she can't read.
Ow! Oh, Simpson, it's you.
- Hello, Flanders.
- Oh, my! What a mess we've got here.
Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine? - Well, let's see.
- Oh, this one's mine.
This one's mine.
- This one's mine, and this-- - They're all yours! - Hey, you dropped your pork chop.
- Gimme that! - Well, happy holidays, Simpson.
- Gee, this is the best Christmas ever.
- You bet.
What's the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lump of coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there, sucking on a beer all day long.
- So? - So, it's Christmas.
- Thanks, Moe.
Drinks all around! What's with the crazy getup, Barn? I got me a part-timejob working as a Santa down at the mall.
Wow! Can I do that? I don't know.
They're pretty selective.
Do you like children? What do you mean? All the time? Even when they're nuts? - Hmm.
- Uh, I certainly do.
Welcome aboard, Simpson.
Pending your successful completion of our training program, that is.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
- What is it now, Simpson? - Uh, when do we get paid? Not a dime till Christmas Eve! Now, from the top.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Um, Dasher.
- Dancer.
- Mm-hmm.
- Prancer.
- Mm-hmm.
Nixon.
Comet and Cupid.
- Donna Dixon? - Sit down, Simpson.
And what would you like, little boy? - You're not really Santa, tubby.
- Why, you little egghead! No, Homer! If such an emergency arises, you just tell them Santa's vey busy this time of year, - and you are one of his helpers.
- Oh, I knew that one too! Homer, why are you seven hours late? Not a word, Marge.
I'm heading straight for the tub.
But, Homer, my sisters are here.
- Don't you wanna say hello? - Daddy! We're so glad to see you! - Oh, Dad, you're finally home! What? Why? Oh, yeah.
Hello, Patty.
Hello, Selma.
- How was your trip? - Fine.
- you both look well.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.
- It's Christmas? - you wouldn't know it around here.
- And why is that? - For one thing, there's no tree - I was just on my way out to get one! - Can we go too, Dad? - Yeah, can we? No! Sleighbells ring Are you listening In the lane Snow is glistening A beautiful sight We're happy tonight - Walking in a winter wonderland Hey! What do you think you're doin'? - Uh-oh.
- Hey! Hey! - Come back here! So what do you think, kids? Beauty, isn't it? - Wow! Yay, Dad! - Way to go, Dad! - Why is there a birdhouse in it? - Uh, that's an ornament.
Do I smell gunpowder? and then I want some Robotoids.
And then I want a Goop Monster.
And then I want a great big, giant-- Aw, son, you don't need all that junk.
I'm sure you've already got something much more important-- a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you.
Hey, I couldn't afford lunch.
Give me a bite of that donut.
Get a load of that quote-unquote Santa.
I can't believe those kids are falling for it.
Hey, Milhouse, I dare you to sit on his lap.
- I dare you to yank his beard off.
- Ah, touche.
I hope you feel better, Santa.
Oh, I will when Mrs.
Claus' sisters get outta town.
Thanks for listenin', kid.
Hey, Santa, what's shakin', man? What's your name, Bart ner? Uh, little partner? - I'm Bart Simpson.
Who are you? - I'm jolly Old St.
Nick.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
D'oh! - Homer! - A word with you in Santa's workshop.
- Cover for me, Elfie.
- I didn't know it was you.
Nobody knows.
It's a secret.
I didn't get my bonus this year.
But to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, - I'd do anything.
- I'll say, Dad.
you must really love us to sink so low.
Now, let's not get mushy, son.
I still have a job to do.
Hey, little ones.
Santa's back.
Ho ho-- D'oh! Damn it to-- Ah, son, one day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday.
Receiving a big fat check for a job well done.
Simpson, Homer? Here ya go.
Come on, son.
Let's go cash this baby and get presents for-- Thirteen bucks? Hey, wait a minute.
That's right.
$120 gross.
Less Social Security, less unemployment insurance, - less Santa training - Santa training? less costume purchase, less beard rental, less Christmas club.
- But-- But-- - See ya next year.
- Ohh! - Come on, Dad.
Let's go home.
Thirteen bucks? you can't get anything for 13 bucks.
Allright! Thirteen bigones! Springfield Downs, here I come! - What? - you heard me.
I'm goin' to the dog track.
I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race.
- Wanna come? - Sory, Barney.
I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to a sleazy dog track on Christmas Eve.
Come on, Simpson.
The dog's name is Whirlwind.
Ten-to-one shot.
Money in the bank.
- Uh-uh.
- Ah, come on, Dad.
This can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas.
If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas.
It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs and it's gonna happen to us.
Well, okay, let's go.
Who's Tiny Tim? Hey, Moldy, do you think Santa will be able to find ElfCounty under all this snow? I doubt it, Bubbles.
We'll be sad little elves this Christmas.
- Oh, no! - Oh, brother.
- Where's your husband? - Yeah.
It's getting late.
Said he went caroling with Bart.
We're in the money, we're in the money We got a lot of what it takes to get along I can't believe I'm doing this.
Can we open our presents now, Dad? you know the tradition, son.
Not till the eighth race.
Hey, Barney, which one is Whirlwind? Number Six.
That's our lucky dog right over there.
He's won his last five races.
What? That scrawny little bag of bones? Come on, Dad.
They're all scrawny little bags of bones.
Yeah, you're right.
I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.
Attention, racing fans, we have a late scratch in the fourth race.
Number 8, Sir Galahad will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper.
Once again, Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper.
Bart, did you hear that? What a name! Santa's Little Helper! - It's a sign! It's an omen! - It's a coincidence, Dad.
- What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper? - Ninety-nine to one.
Wow! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals Merry Christmas! I got a bad feeling about this.
- Don't you believe in me, son? - Uh-- Come on, boy.
Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.
Oh, go for it, Dad.
That's my boy! Eveything on Santa's Little Helper.
Three cheers for Brainy! - Hip hip hooray! - Yay! Unadulterated pap.
It's almost 9:00.
Where's Homer anyway? It's so typical of the big doof us to spoil it all.
- What, Aunt Patty? - Oh, nothing, dear.
I'm just trashing your father.
Well, I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact he has the same frailties as all human belings.
he's the only father I have.
Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships.
So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me, and I'm far too young to defend myself against such onslaughts.
Mm-hmm.
Go watch your cartoon show, dear.
Come on, Bart.
Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it.
Here comes Screwy the mechanical rabbit.
- and they're off! - Come on, Santa's Little Helper! - Come on, dog! Go, man, go! It's Whirlwind in the lane, and coming up on the left is Quadruped, followed by Dog O'War and Fido.
- Go! Come on, boy! - Go! Come on, get that rabbit! Dog O'War coming up fast on the outside.
- Come on, Santa's Little Helper! - Come on, dog! Go, man, go! And with a lock on last place, it's Santa's Little Helper.
- Don't worry, Dad.
Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.
- Come on, you stupid dog! Come on! - Go, go! - Run! Run! - Run, run! Come on, get that rabbit! - Go, go, Santa's Little Helper! Run! - Go, go, go! Whirlwind by a countrymile, second, ChewMyShoe, followed by Dog O'War.
Oh, jeez! Doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.
I don't wanna leave till our dog finishes.
Ah, forget it.
Let's go.
- Find any winners, son? - Sory, Dad.
Hey, hey, Simpson! What'dl tell you? Whirlwind! Let's go, Daria.
Beat it! Scram! Get lost! - you came in last for the last time! Look, Dad, it's Santa's Little Helper.
And don't come back! Oh, no, you don't! No, no! Get away from me! Uh-uh! Oh, can we keep him, Dad, please? But he's a loser! He's pathetic! He's-- A Simpson.
Hmm.
Maybe I should call the police.
- Oh, he'll sober up.
- Yeah.
Come staggering home.
Mm-hmm.
Smelling of cheap perfume.
- Homer! - What? What the-- Who the-- - Look, eveybody, - I have a confession to make.
- This should be good.
I didn't get my Christmas bonus.
I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for eveybody, but no matter what I did-- - Hey, eveybody, lookwhat we got! A dog! All right, Dad! - God bless him.
- So love at first sight is possible.
And if he runs away, he'll be easy to catch.
Oh, this is the best gift of all, Homer! - It is? - Yes.
Something to share our love and frighten prowlers.
- What's his name? - Number 8-- I mean, Santa's Little Helper.
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer Had a very shiny nose And if you ever saw it - you would even say it glows - Like a light bulb! -Bart! - All of the other reindeer Used to laugh and call him names - Like Shnozzola! -Lisa! They never let poor Rudolph - Join in any reindeergames -Like strippoker! -I'm warning you two! - Then one foggy Christmas Eve - Santa came to say - Take it, Homer! Uh, Rudolph get your nose over here - So you can guide my sleigh today - Oh, Homer.
Then all the reindeer loved him and they shouted out with glee Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer You'll go down in history -Like Attila the Hu-- - You little-- Shh.
Come on, Mom.
Yeah, Mom.
Hurry up.
All right.
Mmm.
How about "he"? Two points.
Your turn, dear.
Hmm.
How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters? Oh, wait.
Here's a good one.
" Do.
" "Id.
" Triple word score.
- Hey, no abbreviations.
- Not I.
D.
, Dad.
"Id.
" It's a word.
- As in,"This game is stup-id.
" - Hey, shut up, boy.
Yeah, Bart.
You're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow.
We could look this "id" thing up in the dictionary.
- We got one? - I think it's under the short leg of the couch.
"Id: Along with the ego and the superego one of three components of the psyche.
" - Get outta here.
- My turn.
" Kwyjibo.
" K-W-Y-J-I-B-O.
Twenty-two points, plus triple word score plus 50 points for using all my letters.
- Game's over.
I'm outta here.
- Wait a minute, you little cheater.
You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a "kwyjibo" is.
" Kwyjibo.
" Uh-- A big, dumb, balding, North American ape with no chin.
- And a short temper.
- I'll show you a big, dumb, balding ape! Uh-oh.
Kwyjibo on the loose.
We come from Springfield and we sell swampland you there.
No chewing gum on school grounds.
In the trashcan with it.
Principal Skinner one of my fellow children is vandalizing school property.
Oh? Where? Over there, sir.
See? - Look out, Bart.
Here comes Skinner.
- Yikes! Hmm.
Whoever did this is in very deep trouble.
And a sloppy speller too.
The preferred spelling of"wiener" is w-I-e-n-e-r although "e-I" is an acceptable ethnic variant.
Good point.
Boys, let's see your hands.
Mm-hmm.
Good.
Okay.
Simpson? You might say you caught him red-handed.
Simpson, you and I are going to have a little talk.
Same time, same place? Yes.
In my office after school.
Ooh! Bart, I hope you won't bear some sort of simpleminded grudge against me.
I was merely tying to fend off the desecration of the school building.
- Eat my shorts.
- Pardon? Now, I don't want you to worry, class.
These tests will have no effect on your grades.
They merely determine your future social status and financial success.
If any.
Mrs.
Krabappel, isn't Bart supposed to face the window so he won't be tempted to look at his neighbor's paper? You're right, Martin.
Bart? Remember to visualize the complex problems, and relax.
The test will start now! "At 7:30 a.
m.
, an express train traveling 60 miles an hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, Shh! Visualize it, Bart.
"At the same time, a local train traveling 30 miles an hour" and carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.
It's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.
An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off but three times as many plus six get on.
At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off "but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop.
" Oof! - Ticket, please.
- I don't have a ticket.
Come with me, boy.
- We've got a stowaway, sir.
- I'll pay.
How much? Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff minus two-thirds of the fare from Albuquerque to El Paso.
Whoa! Bart, there are students in this class with a chance to do well.
Will you stop bothering them? He's not bothering me, Mrs.
Krabappel.
I'm finished.
May I go outside and read under a tree? Certainly, Martin.
What are you looking at, Bart? Are those naughty dogs back again? You have 20 minutes, class.
He's a good boy now, and he's getting better and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard.
That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up.
Hey, look at this.
"I am a wiener.
" He sure is.
Mr.
and Mrs.
Simpson are here.
Send them in.
- Hello again.
- What have you done this time, boy? I caught your son defacing school property this morning.
We estimate the damage at $75, and frankly we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do? Oh, no.
He can't mean that.
My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
- That was the idea.
- Oh.
By itself, something like this might not call for an extreme penalty but this is not an isolated incident.
Bart's behavior is unruly.
He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to-- Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant decision-- - Mr.
Skinner, Dr.
Pyor is here to see you.
- He says it's urgent.
- Send him in.
Mr.
and Mrs.
Simpson, this is our district psychiatrist, Dr.
J.
Loren Pryor.
What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
Oh, on the contrary.
I have some very exciting news for all of us.
This aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that the young Bart here is what we call a "gifted child.
" - A what? - Your son is a genius, Mr.
Simpson.
- Bart? - This lunkhead? - Impossible.
No, no, we're quite certain.
The child is not supposed to know his own IQ, of course but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt.
- 912! - Uh, no, you have it upside down.
It's 216.
- Oh.
- That's still amazingly high.
Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school? - Oh, you bet.
- Mm-hmm.
Ever feel a little frustrated? - All the time, sir.
- Uh-huh.
Do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis? - Wow! It's like you're reading my mind, man.
- Uh-huh.
You see, when a child with Bart's intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person he's probably going to lash out in ways like these.
I think we should retest him.
- We should move him to another school.
- Ooh.
Better yet.
Bart, we'd like you to try a kind of school that doesn't rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers.
A school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to.
- Does that sound good, Bart? - Sign me up, Doc.
Excellent.
We're all set.
Here's all the information you need.
Show up around nine-ish.
Mr.
and Mrs.
Simpson, congratulations once again.
I think we're all in a mood to celebrate.
Doc, this is all too much.
I mean, my son a genius? How does it happen? Genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment.
Although, in some cases, it's a total mystery.
Aw, come on, Mom.
You look very intelligent, dear.
No way! How about a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.
You're stifling my creativity, Dad.
- Sorry, boy.
- Bart, this is a big day for you.
Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious? Nonsense, Marge.
Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.
It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart.
Lisa, maybe you should try some of this.
- Homer! - I'm just saying why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.
I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart.
You're a dimwit.
Maybe so, but from now on this dimwit is on easy street.
- No rush, Dad.
Take the scenic route.
- Gotcha.
Oh, no.
Ties.
Don't worry, son.
You can have mine.
Here.
Let me show you how to put on a tie.
The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
Thanks, Dad.
You kissed me.
There's nothing wrong with a father kissing his son.
I think.
Now go on, boy, and pay attention.
Because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations.
You may outsmart someone.
You must be Bart Simpson.
I'm Ms.
Melon, your learning coordinator.
Let me say right at the start that we have one rule here: Make your own rules.
If you feel sleepy, take a nap.
If you get bored, feel free to take out a book and start reading.
- What should I read, ma'am? - Anything you want, Bart.
Oh! A comic book? How did this get mixed in here? We used it last week as a prop in a film we made about illiteracy.
Bart, these are the students who will share your work area.
This is Ethan Foley.
O Memsahib, Bart.
Rabbi has memo.
- What? - Ethan's very good with palindromes.
You know, sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards.
And this is Sidney Swift.
- Trabing norm doog.
- What's your problem? Oh, don't mind Sidney.
He's just speaking in backwards phonetics today.
He said, "Good morning, Bart.
" - And this is Cecile Shapiro.
- Hi, Bart.
Cool hamsters.
What are their names? Hamster Number One has been infected with a staphylococci virus.
Hamster Number Two is the control hamster.
Hi, little control hamster.
I wouldn't get too attached.
We're dissecting him next week.
Discover your desks, people.
Now let's all welcome the newest member of our collective experience, Bart Simpson.
And now we can continue our debate from yesterday.
When we left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing that free will is an illusion.
If you ask me, humankind has freedom a freedom fraught with paradoxes.
Freud shows how childhood shapes our subconscious mind but this helps us to think for ourselves.
Very good, Ian.
Does anyone else have an example of a paradox? Without law and order, man has no freedom.
If you want peace, you must prepare for war.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, it seems the smartest child in the class is also the quietest.
Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives? Well you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.
Well, I guess that would be a paradox too.
Thank you, Bart.
Whew! Tell you what, Bart.
I'll trade you the weight of a bowling ball on the eighth moon of Jupiter from my lunch for the weight of a feather on the second moon of Neptune from your lunch.
- Well, okay.
- There you go! I'll trade you1,000 picoliters of my milk for 4 gills of yours.
- Well, all right.
- Anything you say.
Uh, Bart, would you wager your cupcake against my-- Save your breath.
What do you think of the new kid? A rather mediocre genius.
Yes, not very bright at all.
So, how was it? - Os-os.
- What? - That's backwards for so-so.
- Wow.
What are you reading there? Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh? Tell you what.
To celebrate your first day of genius school what do you say we go out for a round off rosty chocolate milkshakes? All righty! Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without mmm, hmm-- What's that word where you encourage something to grow? - Nurturing.
- Nurturing your brilliant brain so I got tickets to the opera tonight.
Hurry up.
Get dressed.
It starts at 8:00.
Oh, Mom.
Not tonight.
Bart, your mother's only tying to help, so go ahead and enjoy the show.
- Homer, you're going too.
- But I'm not a genius.
Why should I suffer? Hey, Lis, keep an eye out for the guy with the peanuts.
There's no guy with peanuts, dear.
- Geez.
No beer.
No opera dogs.
- Shh! Toreador, oh, don't spit on the floor Please use the cuspidor That's what it's for Bart, stop fooling around.
Homer, stop encouraging him.
Don't stifle the boy, Marge.
- We're supposed to encourage him.
- Shush! Shh! - Who's the lard butt? -He's the bullfighter.
No way a bull's gonna miss a target that big, man.
Who are those people? P.
U.
When is this over? It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
Is that one fat enough for you, son? Let's go get a burger.
So,"Y" equals " R" cubed over three.
And if you determine the rate of change in this curve correctly I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
Don't you get it, Bart? Derivative D-Y equals three R squared D R over three, or R squared D R, or R D R R.
Har-dee-har-har.
Get it? Oh, yeah.
Hi, guys.
Great to see ya.
- Get lost, Poindexter.
- Yeah, beat it, Professor.
Why don't you go build a rocket ship, brainiac? Well, come on, you two.
Don't forget about the film festival.
- The what? - Oh, sorry, Bart.
Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball.
Oh, no.
Well, I guess we don't have to do that.
Um, look, Dad.
I got something to tell you.
Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.
All right, Homer.
Come on, baby.
Right across the plate.
Let me feel the wind.
Whoa! Strike two! Two and two.
Can you still see the ball, Bart? Don't worry, Home boy.
You're not that fast.
Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat.
Whoa! Yeah, strike three! You're outta there! - So, what was it you wanted to tell me, son? - Oh, nothing, Pop.
I'm still trying to get you a lab partner, Bart.
If we don't get any volunteers soon, I'll assign somebody.
Say, what's that? It looks dangerous.
Well, it's really pretty top secret, ma'am.
All right, keep going.
But you do know what happens when you mix acids and bases, right? 'Course I do.
Sorry.
Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that nobody's angry about this.
We're-- We're just concerned.
When a young man with a 216 IQ can't make a simple experiment work well, it doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure out that something's wrong.
Tell me.
Is the class moving too slowly for you? - Lord, no.
- Well, then, what can we do to make you happy? I wanna go back to my old class.
Oh, but, Bart, don't you remember the boredom the ennui, the intellectual malaise? Yeah, well, you know, kinda, um but I was thinking I could go undercover.
Undercover? Bart, I'm intrigued.
Go on.
Well, I could pretend I'm a regular dumb kid.
You know, to study them and all the stuff they do with each other.
You know, see what makes them tick.
I see.
Like Jane Goodall and the chimps.
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
This is most impressive, Bart.
You write up your proposal while I talk to Principal Skinner.
- Proposal? - you know, outline your project what you hope to achieve, what you'll require to do it.
Gotcha, man.
"'My proposal' by Bart Simpson.
" I want to pretend I am a regular dumb kid.
Period.
"By this, I hope--" Oh, no.
" For this, I will--" Ohh.
" Require--" Ohh.
Oh, man.
"'My Confession' by Bart Simpson.
" I am a regular dumb kid.
Period.
"I cheated on my intelligence test.
Period.
" Ah, finished already? Principal Skinner will be very interested to-- to-- Oh.
You know you misspelled "confession.
" Hey, lookin' good, Bart.
- Bart, what happened? - I had a little accident in chemistry today.
Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off.
Come on, son.
Don't be discouraged, son.
I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the lightbulb.
Dad, I gotta tell you something.
Hope you won't be too mad.
- What is it, son? - I'm not a genius, Dad.
- What? - I cheated on the intelligence test.
I'm sorry.
But l just want to say that the past few weeks have been great.
Me and you have done stuff together.
You've helped me out with things and we're closer than we've ever been.
I love you, Dad.
And I think if something can bring us that close it can't possibly be bad.
- Why, you little-- - Uh-oh.
What's going on out there? I think Bart's stupid again, Mom.
Oh, well.
You can't stay in there forever! - I can try.
- March your butt right out here, now! - No way, man.
- But-- Son, if you don't come out I can't hug you and kiss you and make you feel all better.
You think I'm dumb enough to fall for that? I'm insulted.
Shh!

Now class, I don't want this field trip to be a repeat of our infamous visit to the Springfield State Prison.
So, I want you all to be on your best behavior, especially you, Bart Simpson.
Mrs.
Krabappel, I didn't unlock that door.
Uh, sorry, little dudes.
Party hardy was tardy.
- All right, children.
Count off.
- One, two, three.
- Hey, Otto.
Hey, Ottoman.
- Hey, Bart dude.
Any new tattoos, Otto? Oh, funny you should ask, man.
This morning I woke up with this one.
Cool.
I want one.
Huh.
Not till you're 14, my little friend.
Bart! Bart Simpson! Take your seat, Bart.
Oh, please, Mrs.
Krabappel, not next to Wendell.
He pukes on every bus ride.
No offense, Wendell.
- Oh.
- Be that as it may, it's the only seat left, so get in there! Please try not to shake the seat like that.
Now, class, remember.
Do not stick any part of your body out the window.
We all know the tragic story of the young man who stuck his arm out the window and had it ripped off by a big truck coming in the other direction.
And I was that boy.
Uh, Bart Simpson, sit down! I've had just about enough of your tomfoolery.
Oh, I don't feel so hot.
Look, there's our school again.
- Otto, are you sure you-- - It's a shortcut, Mrs.
K.
Trust me.
Mrs.
Krabappel! Mrs.
Krabappel! Bart, not another word out of you, or I'll subject you to the humiliation of making you sing in front of the class.
- Can I pick the song? - No.
The song will be "john Henry Was a Steel Drivin' Man.
" Oh, no.
We're gonna make you sing, Bart Simpson.
Yeah, Bart Simpson, we're gonna make you sing.
That's it, Bart.
Oh, why can't you be more like, uh, uh-- - Us, Mrs.
Krabappel? - Yes, Sherri and Terri.
They know how to behave.
Da, da, da, da, da, da.
Whoa! Da, da, da, da, da, da.
Whoa! They took Bart Simpson to the graveyard Oh, yeah, and every locomotive that comes rollin' by - Bart.
Bart! - Says there lies a steel-drivin' man - Lord, Lord, oh, there lies a-- - Okay, Bart.
Enough! Hey, Wendell, you made it, buddy.
And so, this plant harnesses the power of the atom so that we have the energy to run everything from your favorite video game to yummy cotton candy machines.
Let's learn more about nuclear energy, shall we? Lights.
When most people think of nuclear energy, they think of this.
But when we talk about nuclear energy, we really mean this.
But what exactly is nuclear energy? I don't know, but I know someone who does.
-Smilin' Joe Fission.
- Hi, there, energy eaters.
I'm Smilin'joe Fission, your atomic tour guide to the strange and exciting world of nuclear power.
And these are rods of uranium 235.
Hi, Rod.
Hi.
Hey.
Good to see ya.
-Hey, you guys look hot.
-Of course we're hot.
We're radioactive.
Uh-oh.
Well, how 'bout a dip in the pool? Yeah! Last one in's the rotten rod! The rods make the water so hot it boils.
Ow! Ouch! Ow! And the steams pins turbines that generate energy.
Bart, sit down.
Uh-oh.
Whoops.
Looks like there's a little leftover nuclear waste.
No problem.
I'll just put it where nobody'll find it for a million years.
So, now you know the whole true story of nuclear energy, our no longer misunderstood friend.
So, keep on smilin'.
Now, let's have even more fun.
And, uh, over here is our thermal regulator.
To your right, if you look through this window, you'll see where our water rejoins the rest of nature's biosphere.
- Hey, Bart, our dad says your dad is incompetent.
- What does incompetent mean? It means he spends more time yakking and scarfing down doughnuts than doing his job.
Oh, okay.
I thought you were putting him down.
You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these doughnuts and ones baked today.
My boy's supposed to be here any second on a field trip.
They been through here yet? Come on, Simpson.
If they wanted the kids to see you sitting around on your butt and stuffin' your face, they'd take them on a tour of your house.
You're right.
I gotta get where the action is.
Comin' through! Hey, there's my dad.
Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer! Woo! Woo! I'm up here! Oh, hi, boy! All right.
Who's responsible for this? -I might have known it was you, Simpson.
-But, sir, I-- I don't want to hear about it, Simpson.
You're fired! - Oh, hi, girls.
- Hi, Daddy.
Here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
- Those perfectionists? Forget it.
- How 'bout this? Supervising technician at the toxic waste dump.
I'm no supervising technician.
I'm a technical supervisor.
I've never done anything worthwhile in my life.
I'm a big, worthless nothing.
There, there, Homer.
You'll find a job.
You've caused plenty of industrial accidents, and you've always bounced back.
- Yeah, Dad, you can do it! - Yeah, go for it, Dad.
You're right! I'm young, I'm able-bodied and I'll take anything! Watch out, Springfield.
Here I come.
Don't give up, Dad.
I'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much.
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Mr.
Freely there? - Who? - Freely.
First initials "I.
P.
" Hold on.
I'll check.
Uh, is I.
P.
Freely here? Hey, everybody! I.
P.
Freely! Wait a minute.
Listen to me, ya lousy bum.
When I get a hold of you, you're dead.
I swear I'm gonna slice your heart in half.
- You'll get that punk someday, Moe.
- Ah, I don't know.
He's tough to catch.
He keeps changing his name.
Oh, I think I'll have another-- Oops.
Oh, I'm a little low on funds.
- Do you think you can cover me just this once? - No, sorry.
W-Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.
I don't think you're ever gonna get another job and be able to pay me back.
- Oh.
- Don't worry.
We're still friends.
I fall to pieces - All you all right, Homer? - I'm fine.
I'm just thinking.
Well, I've been thinking too.
You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr.
Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted.
You think you can still do that kind of work? Sure.
You never forget.
It's just like riding a bicycle.
Hey, Mama, where's my fries already? Dad, eat something.
It's got mustard on it.
All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
I don't know what else to do.
There's only one thing we can do: Take advantage of the old guy.
You gotta sign my report card, Dad.
Loaf time, the cable network for the unemployed.
We'll be back with more tips on how to win the lottery right after this.
Unemployed? Out of work? Sober? You sat around the house all day, but now it's Dufftime.
Duff, the beer that makes the days fly by.
Can't get enough of that wonderful Duff -Duffbeer -Beer.
Now there's a temporary solution.
There must be some beer here somewhere.
Ah.
Maybe in here.
Damn! I need money! Oh, no.
What have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents.
Not even enough to buy one beer.
Wait a minute.
Let me count and make sure.
Not even close.
Dear family.
I am an utter failure, and you'll be better off without me.
By the time you read this, I will be in my watey grave.
I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: "Stand tall, have courage and never give up.
" I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life.
Warmest regards.
Love, Homer J.
Simpson.
Nothing's easy.
Oh, looks like young Simpson is going to kill himself.
Well, maybe not.
Maybe he's just taking his boulder for a walk.
Oh.
- Mom! Mom! Wake up! - We've been robbed! - What? - Someone swiped my piggy bank! Your father's gone too! Look what I found.
Almost there.
Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're going! Well, live and learn.
- There he is! - Don't do it, Dad! Boy, this intersection is dangerous.
Someone ought to put a stop sign here.
Oh, Homer.
How could you think of killing yourself? We love you.
- Yeah, Dad.
We love you.
- Yeah.
Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do.
Now I have a purpose, a reason to live.
I don't care who I have to face.
I don't care who I have to fight.
I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign! Next on the agenda.
Police Chief Wiggum will give us an update on our graffiti problem.
Well, it's no secret our city is under siege by a graffiti vandal known as " El Barto.
" Police artists have a composite sketch of the culprit.
If anyone has any information, please contact us immediately.
Cool, man.
- Tough customer.
- Ooh, wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley.
And now, new business.
Homer Simpson, local resident, has something.
Mr.
Simpson? Don't be nervous.
We believe in you, Homer.
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do.
Danger comes in many, many forms, - from dinosaurs that tormented our caveman ancestors to the-- -Simpson, get to the point.
I think we should put a stop sign at " D" Street and 12th.
- The other-- - All in favor? - Aye.
- Approved.
Meeting adjourned.
- Coffee and maple logs in the lobby.
- Wow.
They listened to me.
- All right, Dad! - Way to go, Homer.
- you did it, Homer.
- If they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken.
- Oh, Homer, I am so proud of you.
- Proud? Proud of what? Well, everything.
Your dip sign, for instance.
Now people won't be caught off guard by that little "mm-mmm" in the road.
Ah, what a great family, but come on.
We all know this is small potatoes.
There's a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.
- What, Dad? - I'm talking about that.
You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses.
- Wow.
- Gee, Dad's a hero.
- What'd ya say, son? - Nothin'.
That's okay.
I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.
He also brought you the speed bump, the dip sign, the 15 miles per hour speed limit on Main Street.
I give you the man whose very name is synonymous with safety.
- Homer Simpson! - Homer! Homer! Thank you.
Unlike most of you, I am not a nut.
Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur.
Look at that man.
He has the crowd in the palm of his hand.
Ah, haven't seen anything like it since Jolson.
Who is he? That's Homer Simpson, sir.
He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence.
Oh, so that's his little game.
- Get this Simpson character up here right now.
- But Mr.
Burns-- I said do it! Now do it! Do it! Do it! Our lives are at the hands of men no smarter than you or I, many of them, incompetent boobs.
I know this because I worked alongside them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again.
And I say, this stinks! Hey.
Hey, Simpson, Burns wants to talk to you privately.
- Privately? - Yes.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
- Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.
- Same here.
Simpson, I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
- Sorry.
No can do.
- Hear me out, Simpson! I don't want you to come back as a technical supervisor or supervising technician or whatever the hell you used to do.
I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee.
There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.
The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly Me, in charge of safety? This place could blow sky high.
Nah.
I'll concentrate on my work now.
Gee, this guy's desk sure is big.
I can't let Marge support the family.
This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen.
What should I-- Simpson, time's up.
- Mmm, what the hey.
I'll take the job.
- Excellent.
Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
- What? - Go on, Homer.
Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! Yeah, Homer! Go, Dad! Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is-- Oh, sit tight.
I'll be right back.
I can't do it, Mr.
Burns.
You mean, you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles? Mmm.
When you put it that way, it does sound a little far fetched, but that's the lug you're lookin' at! And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety! Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.
Mmm.
You're not as stupid as you look or sound or our best testing indicates.
- You've got the job.
Now get to work! - I'll get to work, but first I have to say good-bye to some friends.
Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up.
But you can't depend on me all your life.
You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us, and I'm going to have to live without your respect and awe.
The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
But don't worry.
I have just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant with a big, fat raise! Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad, watch out! Whoa, easy! Don't drop me.
- Be careful.
- Homer! Homer! Homer! Shh.

Aah! Ooh! - Yeah.
Oh, yeah? - Lisa.]
Yeah.
Yeah! - Yeah? Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
Hey, what's the problem here? We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
You were? Aw, well, go ahead.
- you love him more.
- No, you do.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do! You better get this out of your system right now! I don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic.
Mmm.
Marshmallow.
Homer! I'm tying to get the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can.
I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic.
Are you sure that's enough? The boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
Oh, Homer, Mr.
Burns just said he liked it once.
That's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word "bonehead.
" There it is, kids! Stately Burns Manor.
Heaven on Earth.
Okay, now look, my boss is gonna be at this picnic.
I want you to show your father some love and/or respect.
- Tough choice.
- I'm picking respect.
Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.
Oh, Thank you, Mr.
Burns.
I'm so glad you invited us.
- Not me.
I had to miss little league for this.
- Quiet, Tom.
Oh, please, don't fight.
Just go out back and have a good time.
Fire that man, Smithers.
I don't want him or his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.
He'll be gone by the tug-of-war, sir.
- Excellent.
-Uh, afternoon, Mr.
Burns.
Uh, hello, there, uh-- uh-- - Simpson, Homer.
- Here you go, sir.
Ah! Oh, yes.
Uh, oh, and this must be your lovely wife, Marge.
Oh, and look at little, uh, Lisa.
Why, she's growing like a weed.
-And this must be, uh, Brat.
- Bart.
Don't correct the man, Brat.
Oh, boss, look what we brought-- gelatin desserts.
Oh, for the love of Peter.
That's all anybody brought.
Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop.
Well, toss it in the pile over there.
And make yourselves at home.
Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.
- Now, you listen to me-- - Trouble, Simpson? No.
just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.
Now remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family.
Hey, Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg! D-oh! Be normal.
Be normal! Mmm! What an adorable little girl.
Thank you.
Why don't we dump them in the nursery and get a glass of punch? Oh, I'm not much of a drinker.
Hey, isn't that your boy there torturing the swans? Bart! Maybe I will take you up on that punch.
Gee, do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised? You're right.
There.
Bart! Lisa! - Where are you kids? D-oh! - Whoops.
- Got ya! - Careful.
Blow a gasket, lose your job.
The father/son-sack race will begin in five minutes on the north lawn.
Participation is mandatory.
Repeat, mandatory.
That is all.
- you remember the rules? - Shut my mouth, and let your boss win.
Hey! I don't know who to love more: my son, Joshua, who's captain of the football team, : Or my daughter, Amber, who got the lead in the school play.
Usually, I use their grades as a tiebreaker, but they both got straight A's this term.
- What's a mother to do? - Mm-hmm.
- Well, I sense greatness in my family.
- Your family? Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there.
And if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average.
I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a little "al-key-hol" in this punch.
- Mr.
Burns, are you ready? - Yes.
- Are you set? - Yes.
Go, Mr.
Burns.
Man, this is pathetic.
I'm goin' for it! Bart, no! No! No! No! Oh, no, wait.
Oh, no.
Bart, don't.
Don't.
No! Close one this year.
- Here we sit enjoying the shade - Hey, brother, pour on the wine - Drink the drink that I have made - Hey, brother, pour on the wine He's here at last my one and only Good-bye friends -And don't be lonely -Hey, brother, pour on the wine - Marge, I need you! - Hey, Homie, did you try the punch? Snap out of it, Marge.
You've gotta come with me.
The boss is going to make a toast.
Well, I'm not much of a drinker.
Why, you picked a perfect time to start.
Musicians, cease that infernal tootling.
"Thank you all" uh,"for coming.
" - Marge, knock it off.
- Well, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Marge! " But now it's time to say good-bye.
Please get off my property until next year.
" I suggest you don't dawdle.
The hounds will be released in ten minutes.
- Did you have a good time, son? - Yeah, thanks, Pop.
Aw, that's the kind of family unity I like to see.
Smithers.
- Yes, sir? - Get that man's name.
I predict big things for him down at the power plant.
Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.
Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid.
Bart, please? Five bucks for a kiss.
I have never seen such an obvious attempt to curry my favor.
Fabulous observation, sir.
Just fabulous.
Boy, I'm glad that's over.
- Now we can go home and act normal.
- What do you mean? Aw, come on.
That cornball routine? "I love you, Daddy.
" Give me a break.
- I pity you.
- Why? - After you.
- Thank you so much.
- Me first! No, me.
Me.
Me.
- No, me.
No, me.
Me.
Me.
Honey, you look so tired.
Would you like me to drive? Oh, Homie, I think I'm going to be sick.
There was a farmer who had a dog And Bingo was his name Oh B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o and Bingo was his name, oh Homie, get in the car.
- This is where you belong.
- Yeah, Homer.
Room for one more.
One of us.
One of us.
One of us.
One of us.
B-i-n-g-o B-i-n-g-o -B-i-n-g-o The father of the family has worked all day to find this food for his children.
Unable to fend for themselves, the baby bald eaglets are dependent on their mother regurgitating food which she has found.
- Hey! - Look, everybody.
Yesterday was a real eye-opener.
We've got to do better as a family.
Tonight, we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV.
We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.
- Happy, Dad? - Yes.
Good.
Commence shoveling.
No.
We're going to say grace first.
Okay.
Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.
No! Ignore the boy, Lord.
Can the chatter, and bow your heads.
Dear Lord, Thank you for this microwave bounty, even though we don't deserve it.
I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions.
Pardon my French, but the Y act like savages.
Did you see them at the picnic? Of course you did.
You're everywhere.
You're "omnivorous.
" O Lord, why did you smite me with this family? - Amen! - Let's eat.
No, I'm not done yet! But, Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you bad-mouth us to the Man Upstairs? I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.
Maybe we should move to a larger community.
- D-oh! - Don't have a cow, Dad.
The sad truth is, all families are like us.
You think so, huh? Well, there's only one way to find out.
Follow me.
Look at that, kids.
No fighting.
No yelling.
- No belching.
- The dad has his shirt on.
Look, napkins! - These people are obviously freaks.
- Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind door number two.
- What are they doing? - They're having a conversation.
The Y actually enjoy talking to each other.
I wish I could hear what they're saying.
Papa, I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes.
Hmm.
I did too.
Better get the gun.
Where's he going? Probably to get the old man his pipe and slippers.
Whoa, look at this place.
What a dump! It's worse than you think.
I just trampled this poor sap's flower bed.
- Homer, this is our house.
- Aaah! - Are you coming in, Homer? - No, no.
I wanna be alone with my thought.
Fans are getting a bit anxious here.
Another beer, Moe.
What's-a matter, Homer? Bloodiest fight of the year.
You're sitting there like a thirsty bump on a log.
- Eddie.
- Evening, Moe.
- Want some pretzels? - No, thanks.
We're on duty.
- A couple beers would be nice, though.
- Two bucks, boys.
Just kidding.
Good one, Moe.
We're looking for a family of Peeping Toms who's been terrorizing the neighborhood.
Quiet, boy.
Let the nice people enjoy their beers.
Ah, don't worry.
This dog has the scent.
- What's gotten into Bobo? - I got some wieners in my pocket.
That figures.
Come on, you stupid dog.
You know, Moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me.
She said," Homer, you're a big disappointment.
" And God bless her soul, she was really on to something.
Don't blame yourself, Homer.
You got dealt a bad hand.
You got crummy little kids that nobody can control.
You can't talk that way about my kids! Or at least two of them.
- Why, you got two I haven't met? - Why, you-- - Here's five you haven't met.
- A tremendous right.
That's gotta hurt.
This fight is over! All-Star Boxing is brought to you by Dr.
Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center.
Huh? What? - Honey, aren't you going to work today? - Oh, I don't think so.
Honey, you have a problem, and it won't get better till you admit it.
I admit this: You better shut your big yap.
- Oh, you shut up.
No, you shut up! - No, you shut up! - Shut up! - Why don't you both shut up? Hi, friends.
I'm Dr.
Marvin Monroe.
Does this scene look familiar? If so, I can help.
No gimmicks.
No pills.
No faddiets.
Just family bliss, or double your money back.
So call today.
Dr.
Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center.
Why don't you call right now? When will I learn? The answer to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle.
They're on TV! All right, time for a family meeting.
Why can't we have a meeting when you're watching TV? Now look, you know and I know this family needs help, professional help.
So I've made us an appointment with Dr.
Marvin Monroe.
The fat guy on TV? You're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling? Boxing, Lisa, boxing.
There's a world of difference.
Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do? Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study, and of all the commercials I saw, his was the best.
- All it costs is $250.
- We don't have that kind of money.
Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep.
- Marge, go get the kids' college fund.
- Hey! - Oh, Homer.
- Oh, come on, Marge.
Why scrimp now on the off chance that they'll actually get in some place? Forty-eight.
Forty-nine.
Fifty.
Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.
That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years? I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.
We're not licked yet.
To save this family, we're going to have to make the supreme sacrifice.
No, Dad.
Please don't pawn the TV.
Oh, come on, Dad, anything but that.
Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead? Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need $150 here! Afternoon, Simpson.
What can I do for ya? Would you pay $150 for this lovely Motorola? - Is it cable ready? - Ready as she'll ever be.
Mister, you got yourself a deal.
All our money, the college funds, the TV.
Homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you.
- Hey, no pain, no gain.
- Will you be paying by cash or check? Cash, of course.
I've got $250 right here with me.
I'm holding it right now.
Here it is.
Look.
Check it out.
If you really want to impress her, show her the big, empty space where our TV used to be.
- Bart! - Come on, family.
Let's go celebrate our newfound ability to express love.
I'm taking you out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.
Yea! There go my young-girl dreams of Vassar.
Hello, I'm Dr.
Marvin Monroe.
No doubt you recognize me from TV.
- We would if we had one.
- Lisa! No, no, Homer, don't stifle the youngster.
Your family must feel free to express itself.
That's what these pads and jumbo markers are for.
I want you to draw for me your fears, your anxieties, the roots of your unhappiness.
Take a deep, cleansing breath.
And begin.
- Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
No surprises here.
Homer? Homer, what have you got for us? - Homer? - Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
If you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure, an ogre, if you will.
- Now, Doctor, that's not true.
- Ogre is such a strong word.
Right on, Doc! Another successful diagnosis.
- That does it! - Whoa! Okay, you wanna kill each other.
That's good.
That's healthy.
There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict.
All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.
- Good idea.
- All right.
- I don't know.
Okay.
Let's take another deep, cleansing breath.
These mallet things are padded with foam rubber.
What's the point? They'd work much better without the padding, Doc.
No, no.
That's not true.
- Ah! Give me that.
- See? Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment.
- Are we cured yet? - Don't be ridiculous.
You will be, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.
- Unortho-what? - Don't worry.
I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the electric generator.
Everyone comfy? Good.
Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you for a very important reason, i.
e.
, you are wired into the rest of your family.
You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock-- -just testing.
- Why, you-- - No, Homer, not yet.
This is what is known as aversion therapy.
When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically.
And gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all.
And won't that be wonderful, Homer? Oh, yes, Doctor.
- Whoa! - Aaah! -How could you shock your little sister? -My finger slipped.
- So did mine.
- Aaaah! Bart, Lisa, stop that.
No, no.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait! Wait! Folks, if I could-- This is not the way to get healthy! No! You don't understand, Simpsons! People, please! Boy.
Someone's really gobbling up the juice, sir.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Perhaps this energy conservation fad is as dead as the dodo.
No! No! Simpsons! - Son of a-- -Stop! - Dr.
Monroe, your other patients have fled the building.
- Stop! You're damaging the equipment.
-Nice hair, Mom.
-I thought we were making real progress.
No, I'm sorry, you're not! You've just got to go.
Wait a minute, Doc, your TV commercial said, family bliss or double our money back.
Oh, but that was just-- All right.
Get the money.
Just go, and never tell anyone you were here! Wow, 500 smackers.
Homer, how wonderful.
Our first pleasant surprise.
It's not the money, as much as the feeling that we earned it.
You did it, Dad.
Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back? That piece of junk? Forget it.
We're gonna get a new TV.
Twenty-one inch screen, realistic flesh tones and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays.
- Yea! - Oh, Homer, we love you.

Do I smell cupcakes? - Ooh! Do I ever! -Uh-uh, Homer.
Lisa's making these for her teacher.
Ah.
Say no more.
- Yum! Don't mind if l do.
- Bart! Oh, man! Keep your greasy mitts outta there.
- These are for Lisa's class.
- It's Mrs.
Hoover's birthday.
- you know, there are names for people like you.
- No, there aren't.
- Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser-- - Bart! - You're saying "buttkisser" like it's a bad thing.
- Huh? Well, you see, boy, it never hurts to grease the wheels a little.
I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad.
I like my teacher.
Sure, Lis.
You see how it works, Bart? A cupcake here, a good grade there.
Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard.
Yeah, right, Lisa.
It's the three roads to success, Bart: Work, brains and hmm-- Oh, brother.
- Uh-oh, school bus.
Gotta go.
Heh-heh-heh.
Doh! - Yo, Ottoman! - Yo, Bart dude! Hey, can you believe it, man? My sister here made a whole pile up cupcakes to butter up her teacher, and she won't give anybody else even one measly little crumb.
That's bad news, man.
Here, Otto.
I made an extra one for you.
- Oh, thanks, little lady.
- You're welcome.
Whoa! - Better let me hold these, Lis.
- Forget it.
- you sniveling toad! you little egg sucker! - Tell me more.
Back-scratcher.
Foot-licker.
Honor student! You'll never get one now, Mr.
Name-caller.
All right, all right.
Look, I'm sorry.
I-I got upset.
In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.
- you weren't thinking, were you? -No.
-I'm not a sniveling toad, am I? -Not really.
I'm not a little egg sucker, am I? - Of course not.
- Then what am I? - A beautiful human being.
- What do you like best about me? Well, I'd have to say your generous nature, your spirit of giving.
Well-- Open your mouth and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise.
Ahh! Thanks, Lis.
You're the best.
- Look, Janey.
Cupcakes.
- Ah, give me that! Hey, give those back! - Hey, what's the big idea? That's my sister, man.
- So what? So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off.
Don't, Bart! He's a friend of Nelson Muntz! Ooh! Ooh! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! Wha-- Nelson, you're bleeding.
Nah, happens all the time.
Somebody else's blood splatters on me.
Hey, wait a minute.
You're right.
You made me bleed my own blood! It was an accident, man.
A terrible, ghastly mistake.
Ask anybody.
Uh-oh.
A cold wind.
Hello, kids.
Everything above the board here? Good.
Play friendly, children.
- Uh-oh, there's your bell.
Come along, now, all of you.
No dawdling, now.
- I'll get you after school, man.
- But-- No, no, no.
He'll get you after school, son.
- Now hurry up.
It's time for class.
- But-- Scoot, young Simpson.
There's learning afoot.
Okay, Nelson, put up your dukes! Whaa! Yikes! Uh-uh-uh! Ha, ha, ha! - Ha, ha, ha! - Oh.
Aah! - Uh-oh.
Stop! - Mmm! Lunchtime! Ha, ha, ha! - Lunchtime! - Aah! Lunchtime, Bart.
It's lunchtime.
I ain't gonna get out of the fourth grade alive.
You've gotta tell Principal Skinner, Bart.
I can't squeal.
It would violate the code of the schoolyard.
Hey, everybody! Here comes my brother, Bart the bully-killer! - Yeah! - You're our hero, Bart! Look, everybody.
I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this.
I'm not sayin' I'm not a hero.
I'm just saying that I fear for my safety.
Look out! Nelson, it was all a mistake.
This is how it happened, man.
Listen up.
You may get a kick out of it.
My sister was making cupcakes this morning and-- I'll see you at the flagpole at 3:15.
And you better be prompt.
He has four other beatings scheduled this afternoon.
Good-bye, little dude.
- He looks so lifelike, man.
- Yes.
The school nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his little face after the fight.
Good-bye, son.
I guess you were right.
All that homework was a waste of your time.
Thanks, Bart.
We got the day off from school for this.
- Yeah, and I got the day off from work.
- Homer! Who wants a day off from work when I'm never gonna see my beloved son again? Oh, Bart! Oh, Bart! That's better, Homer.
Be brave.
Bye-bye, Bart.
You were always my special little guy.
Bart, here's that cupcake you wanted.
I can't help but think if l had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided.
I know you can't eat it now, so I'll just place it lovingly on your forehead.
Hey, look.
They got food at this thing.
Here's one for the road, dude.
- Aah! - Put 'em up.
Oh! Boy, you sure taught me a lesson.
Whoo.
Thanks, guys.
I guess now all that's left is a hearty handshake.
Right, guys? I'm gonna get you again tomorrow, Simpson.
Is 3:15 good for you? Uh, not really.
Too bad.
Oh, no.
Oh, man, that guy's tough to love.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
- Tough day at school, boy? - Bart, what happened to you? Let's just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
So, you had a little scuffle, eh? Heh-heh.
Hope you won.
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.
Bart, your mother has the fool idea that you're upset about something.
Dad, I need help.
Please.
Oh.
Now come on, Bart.
We don't want your mother to see you crying.
- Here.
- Oh, man.
Let me help you dy those tears.
So what's the problem, son? - I had a run-in with a bully.
- A bully? Come on, Marge! I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.
Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.
I guess I could do that.
What? And violate the code of the schoolyard? I'd rather Bart died.
What on earth are you talking about, Homer? The code of the schoolyard, Marge.
The rules that teach a boy to be a man.
Let's see.
Don't tattle.
Always make fun of those different from you.
Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do.
- What else? - Homer, that's ridiculous.
Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding? - What do you mean, Mom? - Yeah, right.
- This oughta be good for a laugh.
- Shh! This bully friend of yours, is he a little on the chunky side? - Yeah, he's pretty chunkified, all right.
- Mm-hmm.
And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies, either.
No, he's pretty dumb.
He's in all the same special classes I am.
- That's why he lashes out at the world.
- Oh, Marge.
So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him.
You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.
Well, thank you very much, Mrs.
Maharishi Gandhi.
Let's go, boy.
Now here's that bully of yours.
Show me your stuff.
No, no! Not like that! Like this! See that, boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.
You mean I should fight dirty, Dad? Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
Amen.
So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes! And then you sock him when he's staggerin' around blinded! - Yeah! - And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
- Gotcha.
- And if you get the chance, get him right in the family jewels.
That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.
Thanks, Pop.
- Whoa! - Put 'em up! Ha! Ooh! Remember the family jewels, son.
Hmm? Oh, no, boys.
Not the can, please.
Doh! Bart, you can't go on like this.
I know.
- Why don't you go see Grandpa? - What can he do? He'll give you good advice.
He's the toughest Simpson alive.
- He is? - Yeah.
Remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home? Remember the fight he put up when we put him in the home? I'm here to see Grandpa.
Half the people here are named Grandpa.
Well, Grandpa Simpson then.
Second floor, third dank room on the left.
Thanks, lady.
" Dear Advertisers," I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television.
We are not all vibrant, fun-loving sex maniacs.
Many of us are bitter, resentful individuals who remember the good old days when entertainment was bland and inoffensive.
The following is a list of words I never want to hear on television again.
Number one: bra.
Number two: horny.
"Number three: Family jewels.
" - Hi, Grandpa! - Bart, what brings you here? I need some advice, Grandpa.
See, there's this bully at school who keeps beating me up.
Let me tell you somethin', boy.
If you don't stand up for yourself, bullies are gonna be pickin' on you for the rest of your life.
Simpson, give me your newspaper! - Why should I? - I wanna do the crossword puzzle.
No, I want to do the crossword puzzle! - I said, give me that puzzle.
- No.
- Give me! Give me! - No! No! Heh-heh-heh.
Well, I guess I can't help you, but I know someone who can.
- Here? - Yep, this is it.
What's the password? - Let me in, you idiot! - Yeah, right you are.
So, Herman, has the large-type edition of this month's Soldier Of Fortune come in yet? No, not yet.
- Can I interest you in some authentic Nazi underpants? - No! Actually, we came over because I want you to meet my grandson, Bart.
Ah.
Hello, young American.
Hello, sir.
Uh, Mr.
Herman? Yes? Did you lose your arm in the war? My arm? Well, let me put it this way.
Next time your teacher tells you to keep your arm inside the bus window, you do it! Yes, sir, I will.
Bart's got a problem with a local young bully named Nelson.
I thought you could help him with some kind of strategy.
Strategy.
Hmm.
How many men do you have? - None.
- You'll need more.
And you'll need to train them hard! Now, let's see.
Ah.
Okay.
The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street.
The Greeks knew it.
The Carthaginians knew it.
Now you know it.
First you'll need a declaration of war.
Uh, ah! That way, everything you do will be nice and legal.
Okay, I can use this one from the Franco-Prussian War.
I'll just change "Otto von Bismarck" to read " Bart Simpson.
" Psst! - Grandpa, I think this guy's a little nuts.
- Oh, yeah? Well, General George S.
Patton was a little nuts.
And this guy is completely out of his mind.
We can't fail! Psst! Pass it on! So, Mister, what are we doin' here anyway? I wonder where Bart is.
Yeah.
It's way past Okay, we all know why we're here, right? - No.
Why? - To fight Nelson the bully.
That guy has been tormenting all of us for years, and I for one am sick of it.
I can't promise you victory.
I can't promise you good times.
But the one thing I do know-- Whoa, whoa! All right! Okay! I promise you victory! I promise you good times! I got a " B" in arithmetic I got a " B" in arithmetic Would've got an "A" but I was sick Would've got an "A" but I was sick Aah! We are rubber you are glue We are rubber you are glue It bounces off of us and sticks to you It bounces off of us and sticks to you - Sound off - One, two - Sound off - Three, four Go! Go! - What's the matter with you, soldier? - It's my nerves, sir.
I just can't stand the barking anymore.
Your nerves? I won't have cowards in my army.
- Ow! - Sorry, Bart.
You can push them out of a plane, you can march them off a cliff, you can send 'em off to die on some godforsaken rock, but for some reason, you can't slap 'em.
Now apologize to that boy right now.
- Sorry, man.
- It's cool.
In English class I did the best In English class I did the best Because I cheated on the test Because I cheated on the test - Sound off - One, two - I can't hear you! - Three, four All right, there's your enemy.
Now hit him! Hit him! Let's go, next group.
Martinez! Steinberg! O'Hara! Chang! Olajuwon! Herman! Die! Die! We are happy We are merry We are happy We are merry We got a rhyming dictionary We got a rhyming dictionary - Sound off - One, two - One more time! - Three, four Bring it on home now! One, two, three, four One, two, three, four Nelson's at the Elm Street Video Arcade.
Intelligence indicates he shakes down kids for quarters at the arcade.
Then he heads to the Quick-E-Mart for a cherry Squishy.
Then that's where we'll hit him.
When he leaves the Quick-E-Mart, we start the saturation bombing.
- We got the water balloons? - Two hundred rounds, sir.
Is it okay if they say " Happy Birthday" on the side? Well, I'd rather they say " Death From Above," but I guess we're stuck.
Okay, our main force will be split into two groups.
One will circle around this way to cut off the enemy's retreat, the other will drive in this way, closing the trap.
- It's a classic pincers movement.
It can't fail against a ten-year-old.
- Heh-heh! - Nelson's at the arcade, General.
- Battle stations.
- I feel so alive! - you know, I thought I was too old.
I thought my time had passed.
I thought I'd never hear the screams of pain or see the look of terror in a young man's eyes.
Thank heaven for children.
Hey, good Squishies.
- What flavor did you get? - Blue.
Hey, you two birds! You're gonna be suckin' all your meals through straws if you don't shut your traps.
Well, looky here.
Little Bart Simpson.
Nelson, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach you a lesson.
Ha! Oh, yeah? You and what army? This one.
Artillery, commence saturation bombing! Hey! All right, you kids! Keep it down! Am I making myself-- Heh-heh-heh! Got him! You, up in the tree.
The tall gray-haired kid.
Get your butt down here right now! Doh! No! Please! - Don't hurt us! - Oh, we surrender.
W-W-We were only followin' orders! Eww! Knock it off! I guess you learned your lesson, so now I'll untie you.
The second you untie me, I'm gonna beat you to death, man.
Well, if that's gonna be your attitude, I'm not gonna untie you.
Ha! You're gonna have to sometime.
Uh-oh.
He's right.
Don't you worry.
I was ready for this little eventuality.
Armistice treaty, article four.
" Nelson is never again to raise his fists in anger.
" Article five.
" Nelson recognizes Bart's right to exist.
" Article six.
"Although Nelson shall have no official power, he shall remain a figurehead of menace in the neighborhood.
" Wow.
Sounds good to me.
Okay, I'll sign.
- What about you, boy? - All right, I'll sign.
- Are you boys through playing war? - Yes, Mrs.
Simpson.
- Good.
Then here's some cupcakes.
- Oh, boy! - Cupcakes.
- Mmm! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun.
There are no winners.
Only losers.
There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: The American Revolution, World War I, and the Star Wars trilogy.
If you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library-- many of them with cool, goy pictures.
Well, good night, everybody.
Peace, man.
Shh!

Lisa! Lisa, are you still in there? What's the problem? Did you fall in? Lisa! - Sorry, Dad.
Women and children first.
- What the-- - Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on.
I'm late for work.
Oh, Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck.
- Did you check the den? - The den! Great idea.
Warm.
No, cold.
- Colder.
Ice cold.
- Huh? -Do you know where my keys are? -No.
I'm talkin' about your breakfast.
Did you try the rumpus room? Rumpus room? Great idea.
- Oh, Dad.
- Huh? - Doh! - Oh, Homer.
- Here.
- I'm sorry, everybody, but I've only got two cupcakes for the three of you.
Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to-- - Bart! -just take mine.
A simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure.
- Oh, yeah! - All right! All right, class.
From the top.
One, and two, and three, and-- My county, 'tis of thee La da da da da dee Lisa! Lisa Simpson! Lisa, there's no room for crazy bebop in " My County 'Tis of thee.
" - But Mr.
Largo, that's what my county's all about.
- What? I'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of it's car.
The Iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats.
The West Virginia coal miner, coughing up-- That's all fine and good, but none of those unpleasant people are going to be at the recital next week.
Now, class.
From the top.
Five, six, seven.
Every day at noon a bell rings, and they herd us in here for feeding time.
And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable-- Food fight! Come on, Lis! What are you waiting for? Chuck that spaghetti.
I choose not to participate.
Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here.
The object of the game is to avoid the ball by weaving or ducking out of it's path.
In other words, to dodge the ball.
Listen, missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way of those balls.
I'm too sad.
Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous.
Now, let's see some enthusiasm.
Play ball! Come on, come on.
Let's go.
In the red trunks, with a record of 48 wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson! Whoopee, whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and 48 defeats-- Oh, correction.
Humiliating defeats, -all of them by knockout-- - Must you do this every time? Homer "The Human Punching Bag" Simpson! Doh! Stupid joystick! Three seconds, folks.
A new record.
Hey, no.
I'm not down.
I'm-- Getup, you! Get off the mat.
Okay.
Here we go.
Yo, chump, you back again? Get outta the way! How come he's not ducking? Wait a minute.
I can't get my-- Get out of the way, stupid! - Homer? - Not now, Marge! - Get out of the corner! - They sent a note from school.
What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oops, get outta the way! I didn't do it.
Nobody saw me do it.
There's no way they can prove anything.
No, Bart.
This note isn't about you.
It isn't? There must be some mistake.
Hey, you're right.
This note's about Lisa.
Lisa? She doesn't look sad.
I don't see any tears in her eyes.
It's not that kind of sad.
I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand.
Oh, sure, I would, princess.
I have feelings too.
You know, like, " My stomach hurts.
" Or "I'm going crazy!" Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it.
I'm just wondering what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world? Well, I-- Uh-- Come on, Lisa.
Ride the Homer horsey! Giddyap.
Whee! Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath.
That helps me when I feel sad.
- Sorry, Dad.
I know you mean well.
- Thanks for knowing I mean well.
Gee, Homer.
Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.
Yeah, right.
Uh, Bart, vacuum this floor.
Hey, man.
I didn't do anything wrong! In times of trouble you've got to go with what you know.
Now, hop to it, boy! Thinks he's some big stupid Homer.
Oh, man.
I'll show him.
He thinks he's so big.
- Enjoy your bath? - No, not really.
Oh, too bad.
Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming.
Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
So typical of Bart.
All he thinks about is himself.
Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie.
She's on my side anyway.
- Is not.
Is not.
- Is too.
Is too.
- Is not.
- Is too! Watch.
I'll prove it.
Maggie.
Come to the one you love best.
No, Maggie.
Come here, girl.
Come tome.
Come on, Maggie! The choice is obvious.
No, Maggie.
Don't go for the glitter.
Look for substance.
All right, Maggie, just go to Bart.
Exactly.
Come to the one you love best.
Oh, no! Come on! Don't let the-- Aaah! Oh, no, not again.
Get over to the-- Aaah! Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.
I am not.
It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket.
Lisa! Lisa.
Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that sax-a-ma-thing in the house? I was just playing the blues, Dad.
Lisa, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.
Go ahead.
Play your blues if it'll make you happy.
No.
That's okay, Dad.
I'll just work on my fingering.
Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
Let's hear it.
You just clack as loud as you want, Lis.
I've gotta find that sound.
That was beautiful.
What's it called? Oh, it's a little tune that I call the "I Never Had an Italian Suit Blues.
" Wait, Margie.
Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on, because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile.
What the-- - Put up your dukes, Homer.
Bart, go easy on me.
I'm your dad.
I am going easy on you, but you're so old and slow and weak and pathetic.
No! Bart, no! - Homer, wake up, wake up.
- Huh? Oh, man.
Here, let me wipe off the drool.
You know, Marge, getting old is a terrible thing.
I think the saddest day of my life was when I realized I could beat my dad at most things.
And Bart experienced that at the age of four.
So, why are you still awake? I'm still tying to figure out what's bothering Lisa.
I don't know.
Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention.
But all the while, our little Lisa is becoming a young woman.
Oh, so that's it.
This is some kind of underwear thing.
Mmm.
Good night, Homer.
Now, now low b-flat.
Okay, Lisa.
"Altissimo" register.
Very nice.
Very nice.
I once ruptured myself doin' that.
- Thanks, Mr.
Murphy.
- My friends call me Bleedin' Gums.
Eww.
How'd you get a name like that? Well, let me put it this way.
You ever been to the dentist? - Yeah.
- Not me.
I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is.
I have problems too.
Well, I can't help you, kid.
I'm just a terrific horn player with tons of soul.
- But I can jam with you.
- Okay.
Oh, I'm so lonely Since my baby left me I got no money And nothing is free Oh, I been so lonely Since the day I was born All I got is this rusty This rusty old horn I got a bratty brother He bugs me every day And this morning my own mother She gave my last cupcake away My dad acts like he belongs He belongs in the zoo I'm the saddest kid In grade number two you know, you play pretty well for someone with no real problems.
Yeah, but I don't feel any better.
The blues isn't about feelin' better.
It's about makin' other people feel worse and makin' a few bucks while you're at it.
Which reminds me, if you're ever in the neighborhood, I'm playing in a little club called the jazz Hole.
Lisa! Get away from that jazzman! - But Mom! Can't I stay a little longer? - Come on.
We were worried about you.
Nothing personal.
I just fear the unfamiliar.
Today's fire raced through downtown Springfield, gutting Symphony Hall, the Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Springfield Arts Center and Barney's Bowl-a-rama.
- Officials said the-- Oh, no! Marge! - Marge, are you all right? - No! I'm very upset.
Then you've heard.
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do? - The lanes were kinda warped, but, oh, the food.
- I'm upset about Lisa.
- Oh, me too.
- Me three.
What are we talking about? - Bart! - Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart? - Oh, yeah, easy.
- you do love her, don't you? - Oh, Mom.
- Well, you do.
Don't you? Don't make me say it.
I know the answer.
You know the answer.
He knows the answer.
Let's just drop it.
Okay? Okay, Bart.
You don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude.
Be nice to your sister.
-Okey-dokey.
-Go on, Bart.
No time like the present.
- Hi, man.
- I don't want your pity.
- Aw, come on.
I'll cheer you up.
- How? Yeah.
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.
- Is Jacques there? - Who? -Jacques.
Last name Strap.
- Uh, hold on.
Uh, Jacques Strap? Hey, guys, I'm lookin' for a Jacques Strap.
What? Aw, wait a minute.
Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it, you cowardly little runt! When I get a hold of you, I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.
Where's your sense of humor, man? Lisa, you'll be late for band practice.
Let's go.
Uh, give me some quarters.
I'm doing my laundry.
Yeah.
Right.
- Where's the video boxing? - It's over there in the corner.
If I were you I really would use those quarters for laundry.
Wise guy.
- Hey, that kid's pretty good.
- Good? Are you kidding? Over 2.
000 fights, and he's still on his original quarter.
Okay, who's next? - Me, me, me, me, me! - No, me! - Listen, can you teach me to fight like you do? - I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.
- I'll tell you what.
I'll do it if you bark like a dog.
You little-- you got yourself a deal, Fido.
- Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man.
- That's okay.
With the tips you've given me, I'm gonna pound the tar out of - a certain little smarty-pants tonight.
Howie! I thought I told you to stop wasting your money - in this stupid place! - Sorry, Mom.
And you! A man of your age.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Excuse me.
I think I hear my wife calling.
Now, Lisa, listen to me.
This is important.
- I want you to smile today.
- But I don't feel like smiling.
Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know.
It's what shows up on the surface that counts.
That's what my mother taught me.
Take all your bad feelings and push them down.
All the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them.
And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you, and happiness will follow.
Oh, come on.
You can do better than that.
Oh, that's my girl.
I feel more popular already.
- Hey, uh, nice smile.
- Thanks.
Hey, what are you talkin' to her for? She's just gonna say somethin' weird.
- Not me.
- you know, I used to think you were some brainiac, but I guess you're okay.
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, why don't you come over to my house after practice? - you could do my homework.
- Okay.
Mmm.
Five minutes, people.
Now, Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat of yesterday's out burst of unbridled creativity.
No, sir.
- Wow, Mom! - Hmm.
So that's where she gets it.
Lisa, I apologize to you.
I was wrong.
I take it all back.
Always be yourself.
You wanna be sad, honey, be sad.
We'll ride it out with you.
And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there.
From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us.
Okay, Mom.
I said you could stop smiling, Lisa.
I feel like smiling.
I'm gonna knock you out one more time, and that's it.
This is getting boring, man.
Just ty not to kill me too hard, son.
- Whoa! - Kid, tonight's not your night.
All right, man, you asked for it.
No more Mr.
Nice Guy.
Aha! Blocked it.
You missed me.
- Oh! - I got you.
Ooh.
Don't try that.
I got you blocked.
And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill! Boys, I'd like your attention, please.
Quiet, Marge! This is my big moment! Bart "The Bloody Pulp" Simpson is on the ropes.
He is hoping I'll put him out of his misery! Well, you're in luck, Bart! Here comes my right! Oh, no! My game, my game! I could have beat the boy.
Marge, how could you? I was so close.
I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game.
You're right, Mom.
I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing.
Oh, calm down, Homer.
Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family.
The next song was written by a friend of mine, one of the great little ladies of jazz.
I got this bratty brother He bugs me every day And this mornin' my own mother Gave my last cupcake away My dad acts like he belongs, y'all -He belongs in the zoo - What? I'm the saddest kid In grade number two

Man! Rusty old hunk of junk! Howdy, Bart.
Hot enough for ya? Shut up, Flanders.
Hey, Dad, how come we can't get a decent mower, like the Flanders have? Just be happy with what you've got, son.
Don't try to keep up with the Flanders'.
Whoa! How do you like my new wheels, Simpson? Oh, wow, man! What an RV! Bart! Uh, I suppose it has, uh, various features.
Oh, it's got everything-- microwave, dish washer, big screen TV, deep fryer and, oh, see up there on the roof? - A satellite dish! - Yes, indeedly-doodly.
But, uh, how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while, and you make only $27 a week more than I do.
Oh, it's simple, Simpson.
Credit.
Ooh, credit! Hmm! Mmm! Oh! Ah! Thank you, God.
May I help you? We're just browsing.
Thank you.
I'd like to see your finest RV.
Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth? Yes we do.
That would be the Ultimate Behemoth.
- Where is it? - You are standing in its presence.
- Behold! - Oh, wow! Would you look at this thing? Man built this.
It's a vehicle.
Does it have its own satellite dish, sir? You can tell your son it has its own satellite.
The Van Star One, launched last February, just for this thing, that's all.
- Whoa, man! - I'm not sure that we can afford-- - Does it have a deep fryer? - It has four of them-- one for each part of the chicken.
I don't think we can afford this.
Let's worry about that later.
Come on.
Let's take a tour.
Want to? Come on - Ay, caramba.
- This is better than our house.
Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
Seems so expensive.
Hey! - How much is it? - Oh.
You're a man of your convict-- You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out, didn't ya? - Yeah.
How much is it? - Well, first of all, I want you to know I like your face.
- You do? - I really do.
I'm not saying that.
I mean it.
You got color in there.
- You're not Roman, are you? - No! Look like a god, sort of.
Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? Hey, your dad's gonna just go in here, work it out and you'll, you'll drive home in this! I'm not gonna quote you a price till I check your credit rating.
And let me-- I want to make myself clear on this.
This is a formality.
If you're saying to me, " Bob, is this guy good for it?" I say,"Yes.
" I don't check this machine, but I don't own the place, even though my name's up there.
Long story, but that doesn't matter.
I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.
Is that a good siren? Am I approved? You ever known a siren to be good? No, Mr.
Simpson, it's not.
It's a bad siren.
That's the computer in case I went blind, telling me, "Sell the vehicle to this fella, and you're out of business.
" - That's what the siren says.
- Oh.
Seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range.
And "weebit" is me bein' polite.
You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.
Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't wanna go away empty-handed, Bob.
Take it easy there.
Don't ruin this feeling I'm gettin' from ya.
Perhaps I can show you something, uh a little more you.
Well, what do you think? You gotta be kidding me.
- Used, isn't it? - What'd you say? - Uh, is it used? - Mr.
Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV.
I don't mean that in a good way.
I mean literally.
This is it for you, you know? It's this or a wagon.
Then uh, how much do you want for it? This is yours.
You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you.
Someone else, I'm doublin' this.
- I swear it, Bob.
- This is you and me.
- Yeah.
- Two months from now, your head's in that window.
- On my honor.
- 350 a month.
Oh, well, I don't know.
Would it be all right if l conferred with my family? Mr.
Simpson, if you have to talk it over with those humans out there, there's something wrong with all of us.
You look like a man able to make a decision.
See that man over there? - Yeah.
- He's buying this.
Did you know that? Called me, said, "Save the little one.
I'm coming.
" Here he is.
- Now you want it or not? - All right, all right.
I'll take it! Best decision you ever made.
You are gonna-- You are gonna-- This is gonna change your life.
Hey, Flanders.
Look what I got.
Oh, she's a beaut! Hey, congratulations! I'm sure you'll have loads of fun.
Jealous.
Everybody ready? I hate this.
I don't wanna go.
That's the spirit.
Ready or not, nature, here we come! Turkey farm, skunks, slaughterhouse? No, no, no.
- What are you doing back there? - We're playing,"What's that odor?" - Dad's feet? - Bart! - You win, Bart.
- Lisa! - Are we there yet, Dad? - I'll tell you when.
Go back to your smell game.
Homer, I'm telling you.
- This is not the interstate.
- Maps.
Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions? Don't worry.
This is an all-terrain vehicle.
My feet are getting wet! Oh, come on.
We're getting back to nature.
- Mom, I'm scared.
- We all are, dear.
Your father says there's nothing to worry about.
- What do you think? Should we stop here? - Yes! All righty.
Well, here we are.
Okay, nobody move, and nobody panic.
When I give the word, everyone, ever so slowly, open your door and slide out.
On the count of three.
One-- The Simpsons have entered the forest.
Well, ha, ha.
Now we get a chance to be real pioneers.
Yes, sir.
This is a real adventure.
Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for this.
You mean, like we just did? - Will somebody help her? - Look, Maggie.
Birdies.
Oh, Homer, what are we going to do? Now don't worry.
Our situation isn't as bad as it seems.
And you're forgetting.
I'm an experienced woodsman.
Now you all stay here while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.
What am I gonna do? I've murdered us all! I've murdered us all! I've murdered us all! - Shut up! - Shut up! Shut up! - D-oh! - D-oh! D-oh! - There.
Finished.
- You are? Well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter.
- It is? - Uh-huh.
Okay.
We'll be back with help before you know it.
You girls just stay here and relax.
Remember, the handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star.
That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class.
We're in the woods.
Should Maggie be going with them? I don't think they'll be gone long, and she's in good hands.
There aren't any dangerous animals in the forest, are there, Dad? Might be a few, but don't worry.
If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
- It's a deal.
- And remember not to act afraid.
Animals can smell fear, and they don't like it.
- Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.
- Right.
A rattler! - I'm not afraid! - Run, you fool! Through here, boy.
Back to civilization.
- How do you know? - When you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things.
It becomes natural, like a third sense.
The boys certainly are taking a long time.
I hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
Bart! Where are you, Bart? His lucky red hat.
Oh, dear God! No! Bart! Bart! Bart! Oh, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son! Why couldn't You have taken me? Of all the fates on heaven and earth, why did this one befall me? Don't have a cow, Dad.
What the-- D-oh! You're alive! And buck naked.
I'm not the only one, Home boy.
What? Oh! Jungle man.
The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: conceal your nakedness.
- Yeah, man.
- Okay.
Slap a fern on there, boy.
And now with some mud.
There.
Ooh! That requires a little moss.
And some moss for me.
All right.
- Ready to hit the town.
- But, Dad, I am so hungry! Can't we eat somethin' first? I'm starvin', man.
Ah, food.
Good thinking, son.
This young sapling ought to do the trick.
- What are we gonna do, hang ourselves? - No! This is a trap.
It's gonna catch us our dinner.
Come on, boy.
Shh! just watch.
Oooh! A-ha! Got him! Okay, okay.
This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit.
And when he comes out, you step on him.
Right, Dad.
Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Great camping trip, honey.
Traveled 800 miles, haven't even seen a squirrel yet.
Well, the ranger at the gate said we should watch out for bears.
- Oh, bears! - Mm-hmm.
Right, right.
Let me show you how many bears there are around here.
Uh, hello, bears! Um, come on.
Have a donut.
Oh, what the heck, have me! Come and get it! All right, all right.
You made your point.
Bears.
- I hope Maggie and the boys are all right.
- Oh, I'm sure they're just fine.
After all, we built a fire, and we don't know anything about nature.
Imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, dear.
G-G-Good n-n-night, D-D-Dad.
- G-G-Good n-n-night, son.
Sleep tight.
- Are we there yet? - No! - Are we ever gonna be there? - How would I know? Quit asking pointless-- - Bart, look! Honey.
Honey! - We're saved! - Uh, Homer.
Bees? - How is it? - Tangy.
What? - Oh, water.
That-a-way, man.
Bigfoot.
The legendary half-man half-ape is no longer a legend.
He's very, very real.
What you're about to see is unedited video footage taken earlier today in the hills three miles southwest of Tenderfoot George.
Now, the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinay pictures was most impressed with the creature's uncivilized look, it's foul language and, most of all, it's indescribable stench.
A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of$5,000 to anyone who brings in the creature alive.
Naturally, we'll have more on this story as it develops.
We now return you to the president's address already in progress.
It looks as if you girls have been getting along all right, but it's a darn good thing we found you when we did.
There's something horrible roaming these woods.
There is? Why, that's my husband! His name isn't Bigfoot.
His name is Homer.
- What does it eat? - I don't understand.
What's this all about? Well, I suppose pork chops are his favorite.
Get those bears out of here.
I'm tying to do an interview.
No bears! We're taping! All bears off the set.
Okay.
Now let's get back to your, uh, husband.
How would you describe your marital relations? Brutish? - Is this going to be on TV? - Coast to coast.
-just a little further.
- Are we there yet? Are we there yet? -just a little further.
- Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Food! Nice grizzlies.
N-Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.
- What do we do, Dad? - Praise the grizzlies, son.
Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.
That's a good grizzly.
Oh.
Oh.
- Huh? - Maggie! Oh, my little girl.
Nice grizzlies.
Nice grizzlies.
Later, grizzly dudes.
Look! It's him! It's Bigfoot! Get in the car! - Get him! Get him! - Huh? We got him! We got Bigfoot! You are darn lucky we got here in time to rescue you.
- What the hell are you talking about, sir? - He's getting away.
After him! We gotta take him alive.
You got that tranquilizer gun ready? Dad! Oh, Dad! Avenge me, son.
Avenge my death.
Last week's capture of Bigfoot turned into the scientific poser of the century.
Although the creature was ultimately released, the question remains, "Who was this Homer?" Was it a man or was it, in fact, the legendary missing link known as Bigfoot? Could I have some applesauce? Specialists gathered at the Springfield Primate Institute for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature.
They are now ready to announce their findings.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh, distinguished colleagues, after extensive biological and anatomical testing, I regret to announce that the evidence we have is inconclusive.
This thing may or may not be human.
That's what he thinks.
I say it's none other than Bigfoot himself.
Oh, no.
I disagree.
I think it is a man.
The eyes have the glimmer of human intelligence.
Really.
Glimmer in the eyes.
What about the sloping ape-like forehead? Oh, the guys at work are gonna have a field day with this.
Cheer up, Homer.
At least they let you go.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Fraulein, please.
This much I believe we can agree upon: This specimen is either a below-average human being or a brilliant beast.
Stupid egghead.
Oh, Homer.
My brilliant beast.
Shh!

You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners.
But I think you'll find that people are pretty decent - if you give them half-- - Look! There it is-- - The head! - Kill him! They got us cornered, boy.
We'll never get away.
Give me the head.
No, Dad.
This whole thing was my fault.
- You run along.
- Son, we're in this mess together.
No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a bloodthirsty mob.
- Aw, Dad.
- We'll die together, like a father and son should.
Look.
Now we'vegot 'em.
- Hey, that's Homer Simpson.
- And his kid, Bart.
- Let's kill them! -Bring 'em out! - off the kid, man.
Off him! - Kill Bart! - Kill Homer! - Let's kill this guy! Murderous mob, I beg you to spare our lives.
At least until you've heard the story of how we ended up with the head ofour beloved town founder.
How long will this story take? Uh, about 23 minutes and 5 seconds.
- It's too long! - 23:05? Well, all right.
Go ahead.
Okay.
It all started Sunday morning.
Kids! We're late for church.
Get your butts down here right now! - Ready for inspection, Mom.
- Very nice, Maggie.
And, Lisa, you look lovely.
Bart, assume the position.
- Ohh! - Bart.
Now where's your father? - Phillips has broken free.
- Get 'em.
Get 'em! -The 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10.
-Oh, no! - Touchdown! -Homer? - D'oh! A 64-yardrun! We've got an upset in the making! No, we don't.
Ty being objective for once in-- Oh? - Let's go, Homer.
- But you don't understand, Marge.
I have 50 bucks riding on this game.
Homer, you promised me.
- This isn't gambling, Marge.
- It's a lead-pipe cinch.
- Here's the kick off.
They took Bart Simpson to the graveyard And they buried him in the sand - Come on.
Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning? I'm just tying to get a little goodness into the family.
- Where is it? The game! Where is it? -Ahh! - got Wolodarsky open in the end zone.
- Catch it.
Catch it.
- It's complete.
Touchdown! All right! Oh, Doctor, we got a barnburner here.
This could be the most remarkable comeback since Lazarus rose from the dead.
Laza who? Come on, eveybody.
We're late.
Bart, I want you to promise me you'll pay attention in Sunday school.
Bart.
Bart? - Bart! - Whoa! Are you talking to me? What's this? A personal stereo.
Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday school? - Maybe.
- Can you believe this, Homer? Homer? - Homer! - No, no, no! We stink.
We stink.
the 40, the 30, the 20, the 10.
Touchdown! Homer, were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over? - Maybe.
- It's because of your irreverent attitude that Bart thinks he can sneak headphones into Sunday school.
- Now move it! - Now here's the kickoff.
Wolodarsky takes it.
And oh my.
He fumbles! Will my dog Pepper be there? I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
- Why not? - Because heaven is for people.
What about my cat, Snowball? I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
- Will there be cavemen in heaven? - Certainly not.
Um, ma'am, what if you're a really good person, but you're in a really, really bad fight and your leg gets gangrene, and it has to be amputated.
Will it be waiting for you in heaven? For the last time, Bart, yes! - I'd like to begin today's sermon, which I have entitled, "Gambling, the Eighth Deadly Sin.
" Today is Sunday, the Lord's day, and yet, at this vey moment, millions of americans are not in the Lord's house.
They're in their own house worshipping a false idol-- professional football.
- Oh, Lord-- - It's a beautiful Sunday.
Perfect football weather for this incredible game.
- And by the way, this game is being brought to you by the good people at Duffbeer.
You can't get enough of that wonderful Duff.
Now they're lining up fort his crucial kick.
One final tick of the clock remains.
If they win, it will cap anamazing comeback.
But it's a 49-yardfieldgoal into the wind.
Make it! Make it! Make it! Make it! - The kick is up.
- Oh, please, please, please, please! - Holy Toledo, it's good! - It's good! It's good! It's good! It's good to see you all in church.
- Please, be seated, Homer.
- Yeah, sit down, Homer.
The ventriloquist goes to heaven, but the dummy doesn't.
- Oh, oh, oh! Me! - Bart? What about a robot with a human brain? I don't know! All these questions! Is a little blind faith too much to ask? - Yea! Don't forget next week.
Remember to read-- That was very nice, Father.
I was pleased you enjoyed it.
I seemed to have struck a chord with you today, Homer.
What? Oh, yeah, you were great.
- Homer.
Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation.
And today's sermon was one you should have really listened to.
- What was it about? - Gambling.
Oh.
He didn't say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he? No! Look.
I don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids.
Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today? The answers to deep theological questions.
Yeah.
Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
What? Those cute little monkeys? - That's terrible.
Who told you that? - Our teacher.
I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us, who roller-skate and smoke cigars? Oh, cool, man.
Space Mutants 4.
Drop me off!.
Drop me off!.
- No way, Jose.
- Marge, they're only space mutants.
Uh-uh.
I know what those movies are like.
Killing innocent people, eating human flesh.
You'll just get a lot of bad ideas.
Hey, Dad.
Can I have five bucks? I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see.
Perish the thought.
Here you go, son.
Share the wealth.
That's what I always say.
Ooh! Da da da da da Whoa! Whoa! Ooh, cowabunga! - Hey, hot dog! - What? - Nice dismount, man.
- Didn't hurt.
- Oh, yeah? Well, do it again.
Nah.
Might land on my face and end up looking like you.
- You little punk! Hey, man, leave the kid alone.
I like him.
- You do? - Yeah, you're witty.
- You do? - Yeah, you're witty.
- So what's your name, man? - I'm Bart Simpson.
This here's Kearny, and I'm Jimbo.
You don't need an introduction.
You're the worst kid in school.
- Thanks.
- Psst.
Coast is clear.
You guys are sneakin' in? - Yeah.
Only saps pay to see movies.
- Hey, Bart, come on! But sneaking into a movie is practically stealing, man.
- " Practically"? - It is stealing.
Well, okay.
I just wanted to make sure we weren't deluding ourselves.
Wait! I think I hear something.
Oh, come on.
Loosen up, babe.
There's nobody here but you and me.
No.
Stop it! I think I hear something not human.
Let's get romantic.
Well, okay.
You little sneaks, you're coming with me.
Next time you little hoodlums ty this, I'm calling your parents! Oh, yeah? Well, we don't wanna see your crummy movie anyway.
Yeah.
We'll take our business elsewhere.
You know, Bart.
I've been kicked out of all four Space Mutant movies.
Wow, man.
Three jumbo chery squisheys, - and one double jumbo original flavor, sir.
- Okay.
Don't you kids take anything.
I'm watching you.
- I've got eyes in the back of my head.
- Four fifty-two.
- Don't worry, guys.
It's on me.
Share the wealth.
That's what I always say.
Guys? Guys? Hey, guys.
Where'd you get all that great stuff? Five-finger discount, man.
- You ripped it off? - Yeah.
Thanks for covering for us, man.
- Go on, Bart.
- But that guy founded Springfield.
He built our first hospital out of logs and mud.
If it weren't for him, all the settlers would have died in the great blizzard of '48.
So? So watch me hit him right between the eyes.
What are you doing? Show a little respect, you insolent little thugs.
We're really scared.
Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Hey, you! You know, when you look up at clouds in the sky, they start looking like stuff.
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.
Like that one over there looks just like a cherry bomb.
Hey, you're right.
And look at that one.
It looks like a guy with a switchblade stuck in his back.
Yeah, that one looks like a school bus going over a cliff in flames, with kids inside screaming.
That one looks just like the statue of our town founder, Jebediah Springfield.
- Does not.
- Does too.
- I mean, without the head, of course.
- Oh, yeah.
I wish someone really would cut his ugly old head off.
- You do? - Yeah, that'd be cool.
Sure would cheese eveybody off.
But, guys, come on.
Don't you remember history class? Jebediah once killed a bear with his bare hands.
- Oh, sorry.
- We forgot how much you love Jebediah Springfield.
- Yeah, he's your boyfriend.
- Yeah! - Come on, guys.
Knock it off.
- Beat it, Simpson.
Man, I thought you were cool.
Beat it, Simpson.
Man, I thought you were cool.
Aha! Wow! Look at these bowling balls, Maggie.
Can you think of a better way for Daddy to spend his hard-won 50 bucks? Now I've seen everything.
Black marbleized with a liquid center.
"The Stealth Bowler: The pins don't know what hit them.
" Dad, can I talk to you about something? Sure, boy.
What's on your mind? Well, I was wondering.
How important is it to be popular? I'm glad you asked, son.
Being popular is the most important thing in the world.
So, like, sometimes you could do stuff you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better? - You're not talking about killing anyone, are you? - No.
- Are you? - No! Then run along, you little scamp.
A boy without mischiefis like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
What have I done? Bart, are you allright? Uh, yeah.
Top of the world, Ma.
Well, then come down for breakfast.
- Ooh! Look at this one.
"The Hammer of Thor: It will send your pins to Val-halla.
" Lisa? Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.
Oh.
That's some ball.
Good morning, eveybody.
We interrupt "Mamboin the Morning" to bring you this special news bulletin.
The statue of Jebediah Springfield, our illustrious town founder, - was brutally decapitated last night in an act of senseless vandalism.
We now go to Police Chief Wiggum at City Hall.
Well, we have no witnesses, no suspects, and no leads.
If anyone has any information, please dial "O" and ask for the police.
That number again,"O.
" Stay tuned to this station for further developments as they break.
- It's just a statue.
- The statue of the trail blazing founder of our town.
It's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Pizza just a statue? - Uh-oh.
School bus.
Come on, Lis.
School bus.
Go on, Lisa.
We've all got to be brave, just like Jebediah - when he killed that bear.
- It's so awful.
Okay, come on, come on, everybody.
We gotta get on with our lives.
Let's ty and put this tragedy behind us.
You're right, Moe.
A beer, please, and make sure there's a head on it.
I said it before, and I'll say it again.
"Hell in a handbasket!" I hope they find the punk who did this, and I hope they cut his head off.
Yeah! Hi, guys.
What's up? We were saying we'd love to meet the guy who cut off the head of that statue.
- Yeah, we wish he were here right now.
Oh, really? Yeah, we'd break every bone in his stupid little body.
- Yeah, that's right, man.
Limb by limb.
- Yeah! What? But-But yesterday, didn't you say it would be cool to cut off the head, and really cheese everybody off? Yeah, that was just cloud talk, man.
Yeah.
I mean, throwing rocks is one thing, but I would never cut the head off of a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands.
-So what's in the bag, Bart? -My head.
- I said, what's in the bag, Bart? Go ahead, Bart.
Tell them.
It's the head of Jebediah Springfield.
I gotta go! Look what you've done.
You wanted to be popular.
Now you're the most hated boy in town.
You're not really talking to me.
You're just my overactive imagination.
- Oh, I am, am I? - Shut up.
I wanted them to like me.
Hmm.
The child seems rattled.
- Can you blame him? - No.
No, I can't.
There, there, Mr.
Burns.
Blow, sir.
Hey, Bart, where are you going? - Uh, to my room.
- Why don't you watch Krusty the Clown? There's someone out there in Krustyland who has committed an atrocity.
If you know who cut off Jebediah's head-- I don't care if it's your brother, your sister, your daddy or your mommy-- turn them in, and Krusty will send you - a free slide whistle just like Sideshow Bob's.
- Wait a minute.
I hope you're not planning to do what I think you're doing.
Sorry, man.
It's either you or me.
You know, Bart, you don't have to found a town to be a hero.
Sometimes a hero could be a young boy with the courage to stand up and admit he's made a mistake.
Yeah, well, I'm running a little short on courage right now.
Aah! Anyway, think about it, will you, son? Jebediah Obediah Zachariahjedediah Springfield came West in 1838.
Along the way, he met a ferocious bear and killed him with his bare hands.
That's " B-A-R-E" hands.
Although modern historians recently uncovered evidence that the bear, in fact, probably killed him.
- But whether bear killed man-- - Mom.
Dad.
- I knew it all along! - Why, Bart? Why? Yeah, why? You little-- Because I wanted some really bad kids to like me.
Somehow I got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world.
- Where did you get a ridiculous idea like that? - Uh-- Lay off the boy, Marge.
He's a good kid.
Quit giving him the third degree.
Homer, did you have something to do with this? Well, maybe I am a little responsible.
- A little? - Come on, son.
Let's take the head thing back to the authorities.
You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners.
But I think you'll find people are pretty decent - if you give them half-- - Look! There it is-- - The head! - Kill 'em! -Allright.
Allright.
- Allright, already.
- We know this part.
-Oh, yeah, right.
Well, that's my story.
And if you still wanna tear apart this young Sunday school student as he stands on the brink of salvation, - I await your wrath.
- Aw! - Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore.
- Neither do I.
Dad.
- Forgive me, sir.
- No problem, Bart.
Look! It's glorious.
It's beautiful, man.
- I love you, Smithers.
- The feeling is more than mutual, sir.
Whoo! Good going, son.
But remember-- Most lynch mobs aren't this nice.
Captions Inc.
Los Angeles Shh!

Whoops.
Whoops.
Whoops.
This is gonna be the best birthday breakfast Mom ever had.
Hey, Lis.
You think that's enough for her? Maybe one more.
- I hope she likes the presents we got her.
- She'll like mine.
Who wouldn't like a bottle of real French perfume all the way from gay Paree? Four bucks, plus tax.
I think she's going to like my handmade birthday card better.
Oh, big deal.
Dry macaroni, spray paint and glue.
Whoopie.
Dibs.
First dibs.
I get to lick the beaters.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Litha, my "ongue" is "uck" in the "eaters.
" My "ongue"! Happy birthday! Huh? What? - Here's your birthday breakfast.
- Oh! Isn't this nice? - My birthday? It's my birthday? - No! What did I get? I love birthdays.
- No, Homer, it's mine.
- You don't even know your own wife's birthday? Well, of course I know.
Sure.
You really thought I forgot, didn't you? - Oh, right.
What did you get her, Dad? - What did you get? Uh, well, a vey thoughtful gift.
But it's a surprise.
You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.
- I think he forgot, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
Come on.
Come on.
Open up! Good morning, consumers.
The Springfield Mall is now open for your spending needs.
Hmm? Uh no.
Too salty.
Um nah.
Hmm? Nah, too corny.
Too exciting.
Patty, he's out buying me something right now.
Oh, Marge.
He never gets anything you want.
He always gets something for himself.
- The tackle box.
- Remember when he got you the tackle box? - And Connie Chung.
- And when he surprised you with the Connie Chung calendar? I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
Hmm.
Hmm! Well, Homer and I had a lovely dining experience at Chez Pierre.
Or the Rusty Barnacle is nice.
No, no, no.
We wanna take you someplace fun-- The Singing Sirloin.
The place where the waiters sing.
- Homer? - Be right there.
Homer, we're having dinner tonight at The Singing Sirloin.
That sounds delightful.
Just you and me and the balladeers.
- And the kids.
- Fair enough.
- And my sisters.
- Doh! How we danced on the night we were wed Havin' my baby What a lovely way to say how much you love me Nearer my God to thee Nearer to thee Oh, perfume! Whoa! Hmm.
Thank you, Bart.
- You're welcome, Mom.
- 34 years old.
Time enough to start over with a new man.
- Someone who eats with his mouth shut.
- What's that, Patty? Nothing.
Finish your steak.
- Look at him wolfdown that gristle.
- Mm-hmm.
It's an accident waiting to happen.
Do you know the Heimlich Maneuver? - No.
- Good.
I think she likes my present better.
- Does not.
Does not.
Does not.
- Does too.
Does too.
Then how come she's not putting on any of your perfume? Yeah.
Hey, Mom.
How come you're not putting on any of my perfume? Mm.
Well, I'm saving it for a special occasion.
What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it! - Bart! - But this occasion is already so special.
If we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special.
- Gotcha.
Told ya she liked mine better.
- Oh, brother! Hold on.
Hold on now.
Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy 34th birthday, Mrs.
Homer Simpson Happy birthday to you Oh.
Don't worry.
This frosting will come right off.
Beauty, isn't she? It's hard for me to judge since I've never bowled in my life! Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.
You always say we should talk.
I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact.
But I'm going to stop in a second, so please, say something back, Marge, please? I'm gonna stop talking now.
You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me.
- What? No.
- The holes were drilled for your fingers.
I wanted to surprise you.
I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store.
You never intended for me to use that ball.
If that's how you feel, I'll take it back.
You can't take it back.
You had your name engraved on it! - So you'd know it was from me! - Homer, I'm keeping the ball for myself! What? But you don't know how to bowl.
Oops.
I'm keeping it, and I'm going to use it.
Thank you for the present, Homer.
Well you're welcome.
Excuse me.
Where do I throw this? - Over there.
- Thank you.
- You're gonna need a lane.
- No, thanks.
- I'm here out of spite.
- Can't bowl without a lane.
- Well, all right.
- Here you go.
You keep score on this.
- What size shoes do you wear? - Never you mind.
You can't wear street shoes on the lanes.
You gotta wear bowling shoes.
What size, please? - 13 double "A.
" - 13 double "A "? This is the closest I've got.
A nine and a fifteen.
Thank you.
Hmm.
A little warm and moist.
Ugh! Hmm.
Hmm.
So, 120 pins later, I am the better man.
I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm doing.
Hmm.
Oh! I'm-- I'm awfully sorry.
Entirely my fault.
It is nice to meet you, Homer.
Oh, no, no.
Homer's my ball's name.
I'm Marge.
Your fingers are so slender, so feminine.
They're far too tapered for the ball you're using.
You need something lighter.
More delicate.
Here.
Use my ball.
No.
No, thank you, Mr.
, um, Brunswick.
- Call me Jacques.
-Jacques.
- Marge.
- I'll just use my ball.
As you wish.
Many people have senseless attachments to heavy, clumsy things, such as this Homer of yours.
- Hmm.
- May I ask you a bold question? - Sure.
- You've never bowled before.
- Never.
No.
- No.
Then I will teach you.
- I don't wanna trouble you.
- Not at all.
I am a professional.
Roll the ball for me, Marge.
Let me see your form.
All right.
But I'm not vey good.
I can hit that one pin all right, but the rest of them don't even wobble.
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.
Pick up Homer.
Pick him up.
Oh! - Now throw.
Throw, damn you.
- But-- You're a very good teacher.
Yes, I am a very good teacher, and I can teach you everything.
I can tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean, which frame is the beer frame.
I bet you don't know how to make a five-seven-ten split.
- Do you, Marge? - No.
But first of all, you yell, "The eight-pin is a cop.
" Let it out, Marge.
Laugh loud.
Laugh out loud.
You'll lose weight.
- Oh, that's very funny.
- Feels good.
I didn't realize there was so much to this game.
What do you charge for lessons? - Twenty-five dollars.
- Twenty-five dollars! It's a $40 value.
Well, all right.
When do we start? We have already begun.
Now this is living, hey, kids? Hot pizza-- the food of kings.
Don't be scared, Dad.
It's not so hard takin' care of us.
Lisa, I'm not scared.
I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids.
Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn.
Does the time always drag like this? First, you must get to know your lane.
Feel the slickness.
Feel the satiny finish.
Caress it.
Experience it.
- Quite smooth, isn't it, Marge? - Ooh, very smooth.
- Smooth? Yes? - Yes, vey.
Yes.
- Yes.
Smooth? Yes.
- Smooth.
Yes.
You could eat off of it.
You hungry? - Yes.
- Four onion rings! Mmm.
Delicioso! - My compliments to the delivery boy.
- We've eaten and eaten well.
What else do we have to do? Let's check the list your mom left us.
Eat.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, clean up.
Don't worry, everybody.
This will be a breeze if we all pitch in.
All right! We're clean! Now we'll put Maggie to bed.
Lullaby and good night Go to bed and sleep tight Close your eyes Start to yawn Pleasant dreams until the dawn - Homer.
Homer? - Huh? Oh, how was bowling? It's a very challenging hobby.
Sport, dear.
It's a sport, you silly thing.
Mm-hmm.
But l think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
You're going back? Sure.
If you don't mind taking care of the kids again.
Uh, no.
I don't mind.
Good night, Homer.
Good night.
- It is for you.
- Oh, Jacques, it fits.
You got it in my size, and it has my name on it.
It's really for me.
Seventeen-fifty.
Enjoy it, my darling.
Here we are.
- You didn't have to drop me off.
- But I wanted to.
Marge, do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight? Oh, Jacques.
I'm a married woman.
I know.
I know.
My mind says,"Stop," but my heart and my hips cy," Proceed.
" Marge, darling, I want to see you tomorrow.
Not at Barney's Bowlarama.
Away from the thunderous folly of clattering pins.
- Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
- What's brunch? You'll love it.
It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupee at the end.
You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal.
- I don't think so.
- Marge, darling, there are ten pins in my heart.
You've knocked over eight.
Won't you please pick up that spare? Mm.
Mm.
All right! - Marge? - What, Homer? Nothing.
-Uh-oh.
Schoolbus.
Here you go, kids.
Special lunches.
Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun.
- Ay, caramba! - Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom? Well, yes, I am, as a matter of fact.
Here's more treats.
Your dad will take care of dinner.
Mmm, Wednesday.
Hoagie night.
Good-bye, Lisa.
My darling little Lisa.
Good-bye, Bart.
My special little guy.
Mmm! Great lunches, eh, Lis? Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call overcompensation.
Mom is wracked with guilt because her marriage is failing.
Hey, don't rock the boat, man.
Whatever it is, we're making out like bandits.
Bart, I read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other.
They go through eight separate stages.
Right now, I'm in stage three, fear.
You're in stage two, denial.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.
I'm not.
Am not! - I stand corrected.
- Mimosa? - I'm a married women.
Don't call me that.
No, no, no, no, no.
Mimosa is the name of the drink.
It's orange juice and champagne.
You're so wonderful that you thought it was something offensive.
Oh, well, thank you.
Marge? Marge Simpson.
You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy, - the gossipy wife of the minister.
- Hello, Helen.
I had just finished eating and was about to leave when I looked over this way and said to myself, "Isn't that Marge Simpson having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?" And I just had to come over and say hello.
- We're, um-- - Oh, don't squirm on my account.
I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you.
Now, Marge, the pins on the three-seven-ten split would be here.
We'll make this little piece of food the ball.
The ball's bigger.
But for food, this is a good ball.
Oh, well, bye-bye.
- See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
- Good-bye, Helen.
Good-bye, Helen.
You have a lovely friend there.
Let's hope something runs over her.
Your laughter is like music to me.
But if you laugh at what I say next, I will die, for I am about to say something very serious, perhaps shocking.
Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again, - That doesn't shock me.
- away from pying eyes, away from the Helens of the world, at my apartment-- the Fiesta Terrace.
I've been waiting for you.
Come in, my captivating one.
May I have this dance? Sure.
Whoa! You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
I like you so much.
They're not for bowling, Marge.
You're so naive.
They are for lovemaking.
- Really? - Yes.
Oh! - Champagne? - Please.
There, my darling.
Thank you.
What cosmic force brought us together, Marge? - Destiny? - Yes.
Some divine pinspotter must have placed us side by side.
Like two fragile bowling pins-- Standing bravely-- - Until inevitably-- - We must topple.
Marge, speak to me.
- Is Thursday okay? - It's okay, indeed.
" For Marge"? Hey, Dad.
What do you say we toss the ol' apple around? Son, I don't know if l can lift my head, let alone a ball.
Aw, come on, Dad.
Get the lead out.
Simpson checks the runner on first.
He's cool.
He's fine.
Here's the windup, and here's the pitch.
Dad, you didn't even say "ouch.
" Oh, sorry.
Ouch.
Lisa.
Lisa, I think you're right about Dad.
- Something's very, very wrong here.
- Frightened, Bart? Welcome to stage three, fear.
We gotta do something, man.
Sorry, Bart.
I'd love to help you, but I'm mired in stage five, self-pity.
Look, Dad.
I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.
I gave you advice? Get out of here.
Yeah, you did.
You told me when something's bothering you and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut.
At least that way, you won't make things worse.
Hmm.
Good advice.
Marge, may I speak to you? - Sure.
- You know, I've been thinking.
Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the side and the guy's hands get all sticky.
But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to.
I don't know how you do it.
You just got a gift, I guess.
I've always thought so.
I just never mentioned it, but it's time you knew how I feel.
I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up.
Good-bye, my wife.
- Good-bye, Homer.
To the most beautiful moment in life.
Better than the deed, better than the memory-- the moment of anticipation.
Oh, Jacques, you handsome devil.
Look at you.
You're really going to strike out tonight! - Ain't you hungry, Homer? - Starving.
Well, then why aren't you eating your sandwich? How can I eat it? She made it.
It's all I have left.
Domestic situation.
Uh, huh? Marge! What a lovely surprise.
You're here to see me, right? Of course! Hey, way to go, Homer.
Way to go! What will I tell the boss? Tell him I'm going to the backseat of my car with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes.
Shh!

So, how was the office birthday party? Oh, it was delightful.
The frosting on the cake was this thick.
And Eugene Fisk-- my poor sucker of an assistant-- didn't know the fruit punch was spiked and he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.
Does this girl like him? I have to warn you, Marge, I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.
Homer.
Just keeping you on your toes, babe.
Two hundred and thirty nine pounds! Oh, I'm a blimp.
Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.
You're not a blimp, Homer.
You're my big cuddly teddy bear.
Aw, baloney.
Yeah, right.
Aw, baloney.
Yeah, right.
Oh, give me a break.
Wow, cool, man! Oh, no! Two hundred and thirty nine pounds? I'm a whale.
Why was I cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer.
Oh.
Don't strain yourself, dear.
Good idea, Marge.
By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get together with the boys at work.
Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.
Homer, is this some kind of stag party? No, no, Marge.
It's gonna be very classy.
A tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.
Eugene Fisk.
Isn't he your assistant? - No! My supervisor.
- Didn't he used to be your assistant? - What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? - Sorry, Homer.
- Uh-oh, it's the "fe-mailman.
" Female carrier, Bart.
Lady, where's my spy camera? - "Where's my spy camera?" - Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera, lady? - Evey day for the last six months-- - Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera? Here's your stupid spy camera! Oh.
Thanks, ma'am.
Whoa, man.
Look at the size of this thing.
I wonder if it really works.
'Cause I got a lot of spying to do.
Bart! What are you doing? Sorry, Dad.
The answer to that is top secret.
- Oh, Bart.
- What? Go take some wildlife pictures or something.
Ew, gross.
Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt.
Oh, sure.
Like I'm really gonna take a picture of my butt.
Stop it, you two.
And put on some nice clothes.
Since it's just the four of us tonight, - we're having dinner at The Rusty Barnacle.
- Yea, fried shrimp! Aw, Mom.
Can't we just grab a burger at-- Only four of us? Who escaped? Your father.
He's having a boys' night out.
Just as I was asking myself, "Where did my seven-year-old boy get the money for a Father's Day present?" I opened the box.
And inside was little Eugene's baseball glove.
He had given me the one thing that mattered most to him in the whole world.
Eugene, when I see you-- the one thing that matters most to me in the whole world-- married tomorrow, I'm going to know just how you felt that day.
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, son.
Where am I, the planet Cornball? Hey, don't worry.
Things are gonna pick up once the entertainment gets here.
- Ooh, entertainment.
- Yes, sir.
Ahoy! I spy the children's menu.
- Ahoy, this place bites.
- Bart.
So, what's it gonna be, me little bucko? Hm, let's see.
This evening I shall go for the - squid platter, - Ew.
With extra tentacles, please.
Oh, Bart.
Excuse me, sir.
The party next door seems to be a little raucous.
Could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please? Aye, aye.
Eh, eh, eh, eh.
Hey, try to keep it down, guys.
- Okay? - Hey, shut up.
Open the door and lie on the floor said Barnacle Bill the sailor Hmm.
Here you go.
There you are.
For the baby.
And one squidplatter, extra tentacles.
- Bart, quit fooling around and eat your dinner.
- Yeah, eat it, Bart.
Ugh.
May I please be excused for a minute? Okay, but don't dawdle.
Your food will get cold.
Okay, Eugene.
One last taste of bachelor freedom.
Presenting Princess Kashmir, queen of the mysterious East.
Now this is what I call a party.
How do I tell you this, my boy? We're in hell.
Look at him squirm.
- You care to dance? - She wants you, Homer.
Go for it, Homer! Shake his buns.
I'm sorry.
I don't usually laugh like this.
Ai, caramba.
Wow, man.
Oh, this is the most fun I've ever had in my life.
The meeting of the Future Photographers of America is now in session.
We would like to welcome our new member, Bart Simpson.
Whoa.
People, people.
Don't applaud.
Let's get to work.
My goodness.
Quite exciting.
- Extremely sensual.
- The subtle gray tones recall the work of Helmut Newton.
Who's the sexy lady, Bart? Beats me.
But the guy dancing with her is my pop.
- Wow! - He brings to mind the later work of Diane Arbus.
Bart, I'd really appreciate a print of your masterwork.
- Me too.
- Yeah, come on.
Sorry, guys.
No can do.
Aw.
Oh.
Come on, Bart.
You're gonna make me a print, aren't you? Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this photo? - Okay.
Yep.
- Cross your heart and hope to die? - Stick a needle in your eye? Jam a dagger in your thigh? - Yep.
Yep.
Eat a horse manure pie? - Yep.
- Well, okay.
- Pst.
Look what I got.
- Whoa.
I gotta have a copy of that.
- Sorry.
- Aw, come on.
Well, okay.
Hey, Bart.
How come Milhouse gets a copy of your girlie picture and I don't? - I thought I was your friend too.
- Well, okay.
Son, why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash? Sorry, Dad.
Wait till I show the guys at work this little doozy.
Mike, this is Al.
Just wanted to thank you for the "informative memo" you faxed me.
Whoops.
Here comes the boss.
Gotta go.
Reverend Lovejoy, your wife confiscated this from one of the boys in the choir.
Why this sheep has strayed from my own flock.
His name's-- Homer Simpson, sir, a low-level employee - in sector 7-G.
- Simpson, huh? - A family man? - Wife and three kids, sir.
I'd like to see our self-styled Valentino tomorrow morning, Smithers.
What are we laughing at? One glazed and one Scratch-'N-Win, please.
You look familiar, sir.
Are you on the television or something? Sorry, buddy.
You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.
Oh.
Liberty Bell.
Another Liberty Bell! One more and I'm a millionaire.
Come on, Liberty Bell, please, please, please.
D'oh! That purple fruit thing.
- Where were you yesterday? - Hey, hey.
Looking good.
- What do you want, pal? - Hey mister.
Do, do, do, do, do Do dee do dee do Well, a "do dee do dee do" to you too, pint size.
Jeez, you get a lot of nutcases in here.
Oh, sir, I've seen things you can't imagine.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I hear you, buddy.
Whew.
Full moon.
Hmm.
Still got it.
What is the meaning of this? Meaningless, Marge.
Don't even attempt to find meaning in it.
There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir.
- Princess who? - Hey, my photo.
- Your photo? - Uh-oh.
- Why you little-- - Why you big-- - Bart, go to your room.
- I'm out of here.
- Look, Marge, honey, baby, doll, I-- - Homer, I don't even want to look at you right now.
What are you saying, honey? - But where will I sleep? - My suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.
Would a motel be okay? Oh, I knew you'd come to your-- Here.
If you have any soul left, you'll need these.
I know I will.
What's the matter, Homer? Hottest ladies' night in months - and you're not even checking out the action.
- Oh, Moe.
My wife gave me the old heave ho because of some lousy picture.
- What, this one? - D'oh! - So, uh, where are you staying tonight, Homer? - Motel, I guess.
Oh, no.
No pal of mine is gonna stay in some dingy flophouse.
Ah.
If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's an open beer in the fridge.
Look, Barney.
See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house.
Someone must have left the porch light on.
Hey that's rough, pal.
Hello, Marge.
- You left your damn porch light on.
- Barney! - You left your damn porch light on.
- Barney! Homer's not made of money, you know.
- Who is this? - Don't listen to him, Marge.
He's-- - Oh, it's you.
- Oh.
Homer, you're overwrought.
Why don't you unwind a bit? Party down the hall.
You know, this apartment complex caters to upscale young singles like me.
No, Barn.
I just want to crawl into bed.
Suit yourself, Homer.
Nighty-night.
I wonder when Dad's coming home.
Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson.
Report at once to Mr.
Burns' office.
Oh, no.
What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson? - What do you mean, sir? - I mean this.
A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat.
This is a family nuclear powerplant, Simpson.
Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women.
I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans.
It won't happen again, sir.
I promise.
- May I get out of your sight now? - Just a second, Simpson.
Smithers, would you leave the room for a minute? Yes, sir.
Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man.
I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk.
And yet, I've led a solitay life.
The fair sex remains a mystery to me.
You seem to have a way with women, a certain-- how shall I put it-- animal magnetism.
Help me, Simpson.
Tell me your secret.
Uh, Mr.
Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover boy.
Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.
- I don't really know, sir.
- Simpson! Well, I wine them, I dine them, bring them flowers, write them love poetry, sir.
Of course.
It's simplicity itself.
I won't forget this, Simpson.
Now return to your work and tell no one of what transpired here.
- Anybody home? - Hi, Daddy.
Welcome back, Dad.
- How's your mom? - Still kind of ticked off.
Yeah.
Good luck, man.
Oh, thanks, boy.
Hello, Marge.
It's me, Homer.
Are you still mad? You are still mad.
Don't need to say it.
I'm your loving husband.
I can read you like a book.
I'll just have some milk.
Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton.
Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton.
Come on, Marge! Please forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Homer, you don't even know why you're apologizing.
Yes, I do.
Because I'm hungry, my clothes are smelly, and I'm tired.
I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson.
Your boy idolizes you.
- Oh, he does not.
- Yes, he does, Homer.
And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay.
You owe your son better than that, Homer.
So what should I do, Marge? Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person.
I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings.
I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.
Okay.
Your wish is my command, my little-- Do it! Princess Kashmir? You must mean April Flower.
She's working over at the Girlesque.
See, I'm tying to teach my son here about treating women as objects.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Uh, but April's over at Foxy Boxing tonight.
Just let me say that it is an honor to have Springfield's number-one swinger here with us to-- Forget that.
I'm teaching my boy a lesson.
Is she here or not? Uh, try Mud City.
We're gonna try one more place, the Sapphire Lounge.
Bart! I said look at the floor.
he really loves me-- There she is.
Hey, Princess, it's me, the guy from the snapshot.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
Places, ladies, places.
Can I get just a little cooperation? It's show time.
I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.
- Uh-huh.
- I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly.
I want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings too.
- Oh, well, okay.
But can we make it quick? - Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Could you tell him a little about yourself? - Well, uh, my real name is Shawna Tifton.
- Uh-huh.
- My pet peeve is rude people.
- Uh-huh.
- And my turn-ons include silk sheets - Uh-huh.
- and a warm fireplace.
- Thank you very much, ma'am.
We'll be on our-- - I've heard them say so often They can love their wives ooh But I think that's just foolish Men must have hearts Made of stone Now my heart is made - Cool, man.
- Of softer stuff Get out of my cage.
- My boss will freak out.
- Oh, no.
- A pretty girl can't look my way without -Don't.
Don't! - Don't.
No.
- Get out.
Get out of here.
Get your hands off.
A new romance Oh I could love a million girls And every girl a twin I could love a Chinese girl an Eskimo or-- Get off of my stage, fat boy.
Hey, it's the guy from the picture.
- Homer Simpson! - Sorry, partner.
I didn't recognize you at first.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor to have a real swinging cat with us tonight.
Homer Simpson, party guy.
Mr.
Maestro.
Oh I could love a million girls And every girl a twin Yeah I could love a Chinese girl An Eskimo or Finn I could dig a Deutschland chick a girl with golden curls In fact I think that we could love About a million girls Heh.
Hey.
Ooh.
Look out.
Yeah.
- How does he do it, Smithers? - He's a love machine, sir.
Da, da, da Way to go, Dad.
Uh-oh.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Stop the music.
Quiet, please.
I have something to say.
Quiet.
You with the hair, down in front.
Oh, no.
He's sunk even lower.
I have something to say to all the sons out there.
To all the boys, to all the men, to all of us.
It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy.
No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews.
Well, not our nephews.
They are our mothers.
And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as this sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than to stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string.
Am I wrong? Or am I right? My wife gets the cutest little thing, right here, when she smiles.
- This is my Suzie.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Here's mine.
You know, my mom sounded a little down the other day.
I'd better give her a call.
- Homer.
- Marge.
All right, folks.
Show's over.
No more to see, folks.
Come on.
Only sick people want to see my folks kiss.

Hey, kids! Who do you love? - Krusty! - How much do you love me? With all our hearts! What would you do if I went off the air? We'd kill ourselves! What's that, Sideshow Bob? This is Brittany and today's her birthday? Well, happy birthday, Brittany! How do you want to celebrate? Do you want me to sing you a birthday song? Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon? The cannon.
The cannon.
- The cannon.
The cannon.
- The cannon.
Sorry, Sideshow Bob, but it's her special birthday wish! You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.
I know we haven't had much luck shooting you out of this cannon, but maybe that's because we haven't used enough gunpowder! Brittany, do the honors.
Don't blame me.
I didn't do it.
Comedy, thy name is Krusty.
Hey, kids, it's time for Itchy and Scratchy! They fight, they bite They bite and fight and bite Fight, fight, fight Bite, bite, bite The Itchy and Scratchy Show Oh, my! All this senseless violence.
- I don't understand its appeal.
- We don't expect you to, Mom.
If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time.
Y'ello.
Hello, Homie.
I was hoping you could pick up a half-gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work.
Ooh, premium-- Wait a minute.
Why? Patty and Selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the Yucatan.
Doh! - Anybody home? - Ooh, I've got to go, Homer.
My sisters are here.
Oh, eight carousels! We're in for a real treat.
Hello, steady customer.
How are you this evening, sir? How ya doin', Apu? - Hello, steady customer.
How are you this evening, sir? - How ya doin', Apu? New flavor-- triple chocolate! Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slideshow starring my wife's sisters.
Or as I call 'em, the Gruesome Twosome.
- Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy-- - Sorry, pal.
Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
Yes, yes.
I know the procedure for armed robbery.
I do work in a convenience store, you know.
You can emerge now from my chips.
The opportunity to prove yourself a hero is long gone.
- This is our tour group.
- Mm-hmm.
- This is a Mexican delicacy called a taco platter.
- Mmm, delicious.
- This is Selma taking a siesta.
- "Ay, carumba!" And he had a big nose.
No, bigger.
And big red hair that came out to-- - Yeah, yeah, like that! - Well, it is a simple, charcoal rendering, but, uh, - is this the man? - Yeah! wait a minute.
It's the guy from TV! My kid's hero, Cruddy, Crummy-- Krusty the Clown! Ahh.
Hey, hey, what's goin' on here? Krusty the Clown, you're under arrest for armed robbery.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say-- - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- What is this, a joke? - Ready, Mr.
Simpson? - Yes, sir.
Send in the clowns.
So, Simpson, which one is it? Well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty! - No, no! Which one is the robber? - Oh, definitely number Simpson.
- Simpson! - four.
And this is all the mail that awaited us upon our return.
And this is Selma dropping of four vacation film to be developed.
Thus concludes our Mexican odyssey.
Hmm.
Very thorough.
I'm home, everybody! -Oh, goody gumdrops.
-You missed the whole slide show, Homer.
Oh, fantastic.
Marge, you're never gonna believe what happened.
I was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my own business when-- Ooh, ooh, ooh, the news! Springfield's number one news team with our Emmy Award-winning anchorman Kent Brockman, Good evening, I'm Scott Christian.
Kent Brockman is off tonight.
Why did the clown cross the road? To rob a Kwik-E-Mart.
The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message.
Wait a minute.
Bart, you know that guy on your lunch box? Oh, you mean, Krusty the Clown? - He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he? - Are you kidding? He's my idol.
I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings.
- Uh, maybe you'd better run off to bed.
- Krusty the Clown is behind bars after a daring twilight robbery of a local Kwik-E-Mart.
- Krusty! - Oh, no! Earlier this evening, the Springfield SWAT team apprehended the TV clown, who appears on a rival station opposite our own Emmy Award-winning Hobo Hank.
And just in, actual footage of the crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.
The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters.
Or as I call 'em, the Gruesome Twosome.
- Oh, Homer.
- So, the truth comes out.
- Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
- Oh, Krusty, how could you? I know it looks very bad, honey.
Who knows, maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along.
Earth to Marge.
Earth to Marge.
I was there.
The clown is G-I-L-L-T-Y.
- You're my best friend.
- Thanks, Krusty.
Buy my cereal.
Buy my cereal.
I didn't do it! Oh, I wish I could believe you.
Good evening, again, Springfield.
Krusty the Clown, the beloved idol of countless tots, now nothing more than a common, alleged criminal.
His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages from eight to 80 hang on each new development like so many Romanian trapeze artists.
From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi, Krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products.
This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers-- Krusty's near-fatal, on-the-air heart attack in 1986.
Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another one coming right up.
But first, I've got a hankerin' for some pork products.
Mmm.
Look.
Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked bacon and glistening, sizzling-- I'm dying.
I'm dying.
But a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back.
However, he was a changed clown.
Where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simpleminded TV mayhem, this new Krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a-thrill youth.
Give a hoot.
Read a book.
Krusty's arrest has sent shockwaves through Springfield, packing its churches, synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizeny from all walks of life.
I urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of Krusty, that clown prince of corruption, and join me in a public burning! So, is Krusty the Clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of Springfield Penitentiary? We'll find out tomorrow when his trial begins.
- Uh, what kind of gun did you use? - Did you use an accomplice? Will you plead insanity? Look at him.
His clothes are so drab.
His face is so flesh-colored and sad.
And his feet, they're so small.
Say it ain't so, Krusty.
My client has no comment at this time.
I didn't do it.
- Krusty the Clown, how do you plead? - I plead guilty, Your Honor.
Oh.
I mean, not guilty.
Opening night jitters, Your Honor.
I would like to call to the stand, Homer J.
Simpson.
Don't do it, Dad.
Please don't do it.
Sorry, son.
You'll understand one day.
He's innocent, I tell you.
Krusty would never do something like that.
Oh, come on, Dad.
You got to listen to me.
Sorry, pal.
Doh! Mr.
Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats? - Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today? - Yes, I do.
- Fine.
Would you point him out to us? Okay.
Aaah! - Oh, man.
- Let the record show that the witness eventually pointed to Krusty the Clown.
These toys are just adorable.
Who'd have guessed they were inspired by an insane criminal genius? But, Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality.
No, I'm not! I'm hopping on the bandwagon.
Now, come on, son.
Get with the winning team.
Hey, right here! Krusty souvenirs! Buy 'em and burn 'em! Good people, I'm so happy you're all here tonight.
But please, just a few words of caution.
Now, we are going to set this pile of evil ablaze, but because these are children's toys, the fire will spread quickly.
So, please stand back, and try not to inhale the toxic fumes.
Ooh! Krusty, would you please turn your attention to Exhibit B.
- Uh-- - Tell me what you see.
Uh, uh-- Which one do you mean? The one with the big "B" on it.
- Uh, uh, uh-- - What's the matter? Can't you read? No, I can't! I can't read or write! I admit it! I'm totally illiterate.
Now are you happy? Can it be that the champion of child literacy can't even read himself? Is it a crime to be illiterate? All right, all right.
See this, Krusty? This is a B.
And this is Exhibit B.
Betting slips-- obtained by this court indicating you have lost substantial sums of money on sports gambling.
Is it a crime to bet on sporting events? - Yes, it is! - Oh.
- Foreperson, have you reached a verdict? - Yes, we have, Your Honor.
We find the defendant, Krusty the Clown guilty.
I knew it! This happens to me every time.
My young friends, for years I have been silent save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument.
But now, destiny has thrust me into the center ring.
In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program.
Please do not be alarmed.
Itchy and Scratchy will still have a home here.
But we will also learn about nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette -and all the lively arts.
- What the hell are you doing, Lis? I'm watching Sideshow Bob.
He's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.
- You backstabber, you traitor, you-- - Snap out of it, Bart! Face the facts.
All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook.
Look, Lisa.
I know Krusty's innocent.
Don't ask me why.
It's just a feeling I have.
- Oh, Bart.
- Come on, Lisa.
I think I can prove Krusty's innocent, but I need your help.
- You do? Why? - Oh, come on, Lis.
You know why.
- No, why? - I'll never forgive you for making me say this.
You're smarter than me.
- So, you with me? - Yeah, man.
Oh, oh.
Okay, okay.
Don't try anything funny.
I'm armed to the teeth.
Bart, look, over here on the microwave.
So, I don't have a pacemaker.
Come on, Bart.
The tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito.
- So? - Don't you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack - when he had a pacemaker put in.
- Aha! Wait a minute.
Krusty can't read.
Okay! Okay! So the poor guy can't read.
Can't we get off his back, already? No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could Krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read? Hey, hey.
This is not a lending library! If you're not going to buy that thing put it down, or I'll blow your heads off! Bart, I'm starting to think you're right.
Krusty was framed! - Did he have any enemies? - I don't know.
But I know someone who would-- Krusty's best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob! "A volley of muskety flamed, thundered, roared.
" A profound silence followed, broken only by the approaching footsteps "- of the Third Brigade.
" Next week, chapter 35 of The Man in the Iron Mask: "The Death of a Titan.
" Well, kids, that's our show for today.
And now, in the words of Mr.
Cole Porter.
Evey time we say good-bye I die a little Evey time we say good-bye I wonder why a little Evey time we say Good-bye Good-bye.
Great show, Sideshow.
Switchboards were jammed.
The kids loved it.
Thanks, Ed.
I glad we've finally dispelled the myth that I'm too uptown for the tots.
And yet, I can't help thinking about poor Krusty.
- We see your face on key chains.
- And water-action pens.
- And snow domes.
- This is all very exciting, but I think we'd do well to explore the more upscale market.
For instance, Sideshow Bob limited-edition prints, collector's plates, - commemorative coins.
- Ah.
Some kids are here to see you, Sideshow Bob.
They say it's important.
Ah, well, we can sign these contracts tomorrow.
Certainly.
I take great pride in being able to sign my own name.
That's a good one.
I gotta tell the wife.
- Hi, Sideshow Bob.
- Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few-- Forgive me.
As much as Sideshow Bob would love to chat, he has a show starting.
Here you go-- three tickets.
Be my guests.
- Uh, okay.
But-- - Come, come.
Let's run along.
Hello, children.
- Whom do you love? - Sideshow Bob! Come on, Bart.
Go with the flow.
- How much do you love me? - With all our hearts! About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty.
Today's show promises to be a marvelous celebration of the human spirit.
But first, I regret to say I see a youngster who looks troubled.
- What's your name, young man? - Bart Simpson, sir.
Hmm.
Well, perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring preadolescent turmoil.
- I call it "Choices.
" - I don't think so, sir.
Bart, I'm reaching out to you.
So, what's on your mind, Bart? - I bet the other children don't accept you.
- True, Sideshow Bob.
But that doesn't bother me.
You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed.
- Framed? - Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart.
But Krusty couldn't go near the thing, not with his pacemaker.
Well, you know, Bart.
As much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctor's orders too seriously.
Well, maybe, but get this.
Krusty was illiterate, and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books.
Ah, well, Bart.
The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield Review of Books.
Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.
Yeah, I guess those are kind of funny.
Bart, children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us.
But we must get on with our lives.
Let's try to remember Krusty, not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car.
- And shot you out of a cannon.
- And shot me out of a cannon.
Yes, we will never forget that, will we? Bart, open you heart.
I admit I have some mighty big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill.
Big shoes to fill-- In ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicism.
Wait a minute! You did it! - Excuse me? - Attention, fellow children! Krusty didn't rob that store! Sideshow Bob framed him, and I got proof! Ow! My foot! You lousy, stupid, clumsy-- - See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes, but he's got little feet like all good-hearted people! Sideshow Bob really fills his shoes with big ugly feet.
- Kid's right.
- How do you figure we missed that? Get off your duffs, boys.
Get down to that studio! Yes, I admit it.
I hated him! His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years.
I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites.
That's why I framed Krusty! And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids.
- Take him away, boys.
- Treat kids as equals! They're people too! They're smarter than you think.
They were smart enough to catch me! Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake.
Uh, it won't happen again.
- It better not, you dimwit! - Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court.
I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.
Well, the important thing is that I regain the trust of the children.
But there was one boy who trusted me all along.
Bart? - Yes, sir? - Thank you.
Shh.

Now to our own pie in the sky-- Bill Pie in the KBBL trafficcopter.
-So come in, Bill.
- Bad news, drivers.
There's an overturned melon truck on the interstate.
Oh, it's a mess.
There's lots of rubber neck in gandmelon wrestling going on, so expect delays-- - Hey, doughnuts! - Bart, there's one left, and it's mine.
Oh! - Aw, Homer! - Aw, Dad! - Uh-oh, schoolbus! Cool your jets, man.
We're comin'.
You forgot the special lunches I made.
- That's okay, Mom! - We got money! - Now, just a darn-- - Aah! Mmm.
Oh.
- This is Bill Pie, your pie in the sky, saying good-bye.
-KBBL Well, Maggie, it's just you and me again.
This is KBBL, K-Babble, all talk, 24 hours a day.
If you'd like to share your embarrassing problem with our audience, we invite you to call our therapist of the airwaves, Dr.
Marvin Monroe.
Our number is 555-PAI N.
Don't be afraid.
Call now.
- Hello.
I'd like to talk to Dr.
Monroe.
- First name, age, problem? I'm Marge, 34, and my problem is my husband.
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't appreciate me.
I don't know how much more of this I can-- Save your whining for when you're on the air, okay? Okay, let's see.
Next we have Marge.
She's 34 and trapped in a loveless sham of a marriage.
Hey, turn it up.
I love hearing those wackos.
- Tell me 'bout your husband, Marge.
- Well-- When we were dating, he was sweeter and more romantic and 40 pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils.
What was that last thing you said? Ah.
Isn't that your wife, Homer? Don't be ridiculous.
My wife worships the ground I walk on.
Marge, it's what I call "harsh reality time.
" Your husband sees you as nothing.
- Oh.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
- No, no, no, don't hang up.
The pig has made you into his mother.
You are not the hot love object you deserve to be.
The pig has made you into his mother.
You are not the hot love object you deserve to be.
you've got to tell him you're fed up, and if he doesn't start loving, you will be leaving.
Leave Homer? - Don't use his real name! - Leave Pedro? - Can you be that honest? - Yeah.
- You'll tell him right when he comes home from work.
- Yeah! - Say it like you mean it.
- Yeah! Attagirl.
Come on, Bart.
Not again.
Where's your sense of humor? - Moe's Tavern.
- Hello.
Is Al there? - Al? - Yeah, Al.
Last name, Coholic.
Lemme check.
Phone call for Al, Al Coholic! Is there an Al Coholic here? Wait a minute.
Listen, you little yellow-bellied rat jackass.
If I ever find out who you are, I'll kill ya! I hope you do find that punk someday, Moe.
Fill 'er up.
Is everything okay? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, beef jerky, pickled eggs, and you're outta here.
Let's just say I don't feel like goin' home tonight.
jar, please.
Hey, you can level with me.
- You got a domestic situation? - You might say that.
My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
- Homer.
- What? - Marge is right.
You are a pig.
You can ask anyone in this bar.
- What? Hey, Barney, am I a pig? You're no more of a pig than I am.
- Oh, no! - See? You're a pig.
Barney's a pig.
Lary's a pig.
We're all pigs.
Except for one difference.
Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off and act like human beings.
Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town.
Candles, table cloth, the whole nine yards.
Gee, a romantic evening.
Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.
I'm not done.
After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town and not check out until the next morning, if you get my drift.
I read you loud and clear.
Heh, heh, heh, heh! Wow, a quarter past 6:00.
- What's keeping Dad? - Yeah, who'd possibly be late on meatloaf night? Uh, I'd like some flowers.
- What kind of flowers? - You know, pretty ones, not dead.
We have some beautiful long-stem roses.
- They're $55 a dozen.
- One, please.
- Hey, Mom.
- How 'bout some grub? Aaah! Your husband sees you as nothing, as nothing.
The pig has made you into his mother, his mother.
You are not the hot love object you deserve to be, deserve to be, deserve to be.
If he doesn't start loving, leave him, leave him, leave him, leave him.
Marge, I, uh-- love you.
No, that's not good.
Marge, honey, I love you.
Oh.
Um-- Marge, I love ya, baby.
Marge, sweetie,"hooney," honey-- Ah, this'll never work.
- I love you, Marjorie.
- Oh, Homer.
I love you too.
Mmmwha! A little predinner entertainment.
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Oliver there? - Who? - Oliver Klozoff.
Hold on.
I'll check.
Oliver Klozoff! Call for Oliver Klozoff! And I made reservations at the Chez Paree.
But, Homer, it's so expensive.
It matters not, mon frere.
And after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the Offramp Inn.
Oh, Homer! I feel giddy! Wait.
What about a baby-sitter? - Oops.
- Not to worry.
Listen, ya lousy bum.
If I ever get a hold of you, I'll cut your belly open.
Goodness.
Must be a crossed wire.
- Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Baby-sitting Service.
- This is Marge Simpson.
-I'd like a baby-sitter for the evening.
-Wait a minute.
The Simpsons.
Lady, you've gotta be kidding! - Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Baby-sitting Service.
Hello.
This is Mr.
S-Sampson.
Did your wife just call a second ago? - No, I said Sampson, not Simpson.
- Thank God! Those Simpsons, what a bunch of savages! - Especially that big-ape father.
- Doh! Actually, the Simpsons are neighbors of ours, and we've found them to be a quite misunderstood and underrated family.
Mom, you look so glamorous.
Well, tonight is a very special night.
Your father is taking me out for dinner and dancing.
- Dad dances? - Like an angel.
Ba, ba Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba, ba Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba - Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba-ba - Work that body, Homer.
- You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man.
- Not if l can help it.
Son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo.
- You don't have a clue, do you, Dad? - Out, boy.
- Out! - What a grump.
Hm.
Hm.
Hmm! Hm, hm.
Hmm? Hee.
Smooth as a baby's behind! Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba Precious, I think I hear the doorbell.
I think you're right, dumplin'.
Bart! Get the door! Aye, aye, mambo man.
Oof! - Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba, ba - You must be the baby-sitter.
- Yes.
I am Miss Botz.
-just don't stand there, boy.
- Help Miss Botz with her suitcases.
- I can handle my own luggage.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Here are the phone numbers of the restaurant where we'll be dining and the motel where we'll be spending the night.
You'll have to put Maggie to bed now, but Bart and Lisa can stay up for another hour.
Until then, they can watch a tape from our video library.
Oh, boy! The Happy Little Elves Meet the Curious Bear Cub.
Oh, the Elves! The Elves! Bye, kids! Watch out for the boy.
Mmmwha! Bye, now.
Mmmwha! Be good.
- Mmmwha! Gotta go.
-Ba, ba Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba, ba, ba Come, children.
Let's go watch The Happy Little Elves.
We've seen the Crappy Little Elves about 14 billion times.
- Maybe we can watch some real TV.
- We're gonna watch the tape.
Aw! That's merely suggested viewing matter, lady.
Mom lets us watch what ever we want.
I said you're gonna watch this tape.
And you're gonna do what I say, or I'm gonna do something to you.
And I don't know what that is, because everybody has always done what I say.
They all look so tasty, but I think I'll eat this one right there.
- Why don't you pick one that's a little more frisky, sir.
- Why? Well, when you choose one that's floating upside down, it somewhat defeats the purpose of selecting a live lobster.
Oh, okay.
Then I'll take that one there with the beady eyes.
Excellent choice, sir.
May I lead you to your table? Oui, oui.
After you.
And I'll be seeing you later.
Help! Help! Faster, faster! We gotta save Bubbles.
Oh, man, I can't take it anymore.
- But I want to see what happens! - You know what happens.
They find Captain Kook's treasure.
All the elves dance around like idiots.
I puke.
The end.
Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love.
Now for some real TV.
All right! America's Most Armed and Dangerous.
Oh, no! Bart! We'll have nightmares! Relax.
This is cinema verite.
When the brutal, slow-motion killing starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes.
The Cue Ball Killer should be considered extremely armed and dangerous.
If you think you've seen him, call 1 -800-U-SQUEAL.
Homer, you look just like a little boy.
- 'Cause I'm so care free? - No, because you're wearing a bib.
- More champagne? - Mmm.
Whoops.
Time for a fill-up.
Garcon! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
The defenseless youngsters were tied up and gagged in the living room while the bandit roamed through the house at will, stealing the valuable objects it took the family a lifetime to shop for.
You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating.
Except for one thing-- no chaperone.
Ho, ho, hoo! The Baby-sitter Bandit has left a trail of her daring nighttime robberies across the continental United States.
She could be lurking anywhere, about to descend upon another house full of unsuspecting dupes.
- Eee! - Wow! In a moment, we will show you a picture of the real Baby-sitter Bandit, Miss Lucille Botzcowski.
- Remember, she may be using a clever alias - Botz! And should be considered armed and dangerous! - Aaah! - Aaah! -Aaah! -Aaah! Run for it! Oh, no! Don't forget to tell me when you see the Offramp.
Oh, thereit-- went.
No problemo.
We'll just get off at the next exit.
Bart.
Bart.
Bart.
Bart.
Hmm.
Time to brush your teeth, wash your face and say your prayers.
Are you in here? Oh! Homemade pickled beets.
Go ahead.
Take 'em all.
Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
Come on! Come on! Finally! Hello, vigilant viewer.
You have reached America's Most Armed and Dangerous.
I'm calling to report the Baby-sitter Bandit! She's in our house right-- Come on, Marge.
Let me carry you over the threshold.
Okay, but watch out.
Don't slam my head like last time.
Sheesh! Eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it! - Don't muss my hair! - Ohh! Oh! Oh! Yi! Oh! Yeow! Yi! Oh! Yeow! Whee! This is fun! We know who you are, Miss Botz.
Or should I say Miss Botzcowski? - You're the Baby-sitter Bandit.
- You're a smart, young man, Bart.
- I hope you're smart enough to keep your mouth shut.
- He isn't.
You're crazy if you think you're gonna get away with this.
You can't-- I'm really not a bad person.
Here.
While I finish up, you guys can watch the rest of your favorite videocassette.
Quiet, Bart! Let's make the best of this.
Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
Oh! Your blue thing with the things? - You'll see.
- Well, shake a leg, mama.
Kidstuff! Hardly worth it.
Lotta junk.
Soileds.
Stupid Sampsons.
Maggie! Maggie! Come here! - Good-bye! - Good-bye, everybody! - Bye! - Yea! Maggie, wanna watch The Happy Little Elves again? Okay, but you have to untie me first.
Oh, Homer! Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Oh, so you got out of your crib.
I guess you need to be tied up too.
Maggie, where are you? Maggie! Maggie! Heh, heh, heh.
Homer, would it spoil the mood if I called home, you know, just to check on the kids? Homer, wake up! There's no answer at home.
- So? -So I'm worried.
I think we should go home.
All right.
I suppose my work here is done.
Heh, heh, heh, heh! Hello, vigilant viewer.
How may we help you? We caught her! We caught the Baby-sitter Bandit! She's tied up at our house.
- Ask if there's a reward.
- Is there a reward? - If she's convicted, we get T-shirts! - Yeah! - How come all the lights are on? - I don't like the looks of this.
Miss Botz! Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now? We're so sorry.
We're so sorry! Please turn off the TV.
I can't tell you how chagrined we are about all of this.
Oh, these things are heavy.
Just so there's no hard feelings, here's double your pay.
- No, no, triple.
- Thank you.
- Mr.
Sampson, can I give you a bit of advice? - Sure.
Don't turn your back on that boy for a second.
Ain't that the truth? You know, one time he-- - Huh? This way to the scene of the crime, men! I got her tied up in the den.
Just a minute, young man! I don't know what kind of shenanigans you've been pulling this time, but I just had to untie your baby-sitter and pay her off so that-- Excuse me.
Are you saying to the world that you just aided and abetted the escape of the notorious Baby-sitter Bandit? - The what? - The Baby-sitter Bandit.
Oh, uh, a-are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her.
This is on, right? Because actually it was quite a struggle.
Oh, Homer! Have you ever seen a kung fu movie? It was just like that.
But now I know her moves.
So, if you're listening to me, lady, you'd better think long and hard before tying something like this on Homer Simpson again! Lord, help me.
I'm just not that bright.
Oh, Homer, don't say that.
The way I see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hogtie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right.
Yeah.
Yeah! Mmmmwha! Honey, can we make up again? Oh, my goodness! Shh!

Bart, no more interruptions during Martin's book report.
Never have I seen a more noble thing than you, brother.
I do not care who kills who.
To catch a fish, to kill a bull, to make love to a woman.
To live.
I thank you.
Oh, absolutely brilliant! I truly believed you were Hemingway.
Bravo, Martin.
-Call me Papa.
-Some ketchup for your buns, Papa? We have time for one more report.
Bart Simpson? Is your book report ready? Is it ready? What a question! Students, prepare to be dazzled.
The name of the book that I read was Treasure Island.
It's about these pirates with patches over their eyes and shiny gold teeth.
And green birds on their shoulders.
Did I mention it was written by Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by McGraw-Hill.
So in conclusion, on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being the highest, 1 the lowest, and 5 average, I give it a 9.
Questions? No? Then I'll sit down.
Did you read the book? I'm insulted.
Is this a book report or a witch hunt? Then perhaps you'll tell us the name of the pirate.
Blackbeard, Captain Nemo, Captain Hook, Bluebeard.
-Bluebeard? -Sit down.
I'll see you after class.
Your grades have gotten worse.
-Did you know that? -Yes, ma'am.
-Did you know there's a test tomorrow? -Yes, ma'am.
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Yes, ma'am.
-You haven't been paying attention! -Yes, ma'am.
Then what did I say? -Straighten up and fly right? -Lucky guess.
Take that, granny! Hide! Deadly mothballs.
Granny's kissing me! You reached the level of ungrateful grandchild.
Try again, if you dare! A couple more games and I'll hit the books.
Soup's on! Hurry up, or it'll get that skin.
I hate that icky soup skin.
After dinner, it's down to business.
-Marge, get me another beer.
-Wait, Lisa has some news.
-He doesn't care, Mom.
-I do.
I want a beer while I'm caring.
Homer! Go ahead, Lisa.
I got an A on my vocabulary test.
You did! Well, that's just.
Oh, what a glorious day! Hand me your paper.
I'll put it on the refrigerator.
I might as well kill two birds with one stone.
You covered up my paper! Look at those funny little whiskers.
That reminds me.
It's Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie.
No, Dad, I should really-- Gorilla the Conqueror.
The granddaddy of them all.
Well, maybe just one more hour.
It's so unfair.
Just because he's different.
Time to hit the books.
Burning the candle at both ends, boy? All right, let's take care of some business.
"Chapter One: A Dream of Freedom.
" On September 15, 1620, separatists from the Church of England some living in Holland, left Plymouth, England.
"Their destination was.
" Marge, come take a look at this.
The little tiger tries so hard.
Why does he keep failing? Just a little dim, I guess.
Bart, you're gonna miss your bus.
Hey, Bart-dude.
You look freaked.
I got a test I'm not ready for.
Can you crash the bus? Sorry, I can't do it on purpose.
But maybe you'll get lucky.
Okay, don't panic.
Find an egghead and pump him for some answers.
I bet he didn't study again.
-Now he'll try to get answers from us.
-He's pathetic.
-Morning, girls.
-Good morning, Bart.
Who's up for a cram session? I'll go first.
-Name the pilgrim's boat.
-The Spirit of St.
Louis.
-Where'd they land? -Sunny Acapulco.
-Why'd they leave England? -Giant rats.
Cool, history's coming alive.
I don't know why I should care but the information that you just received is erroneous.
You're saying-- A blindfolded chimp with a pencil in his teeth has more chances than you.
Thanks for the pep talk.
All right, take one and pass the rest back.
Think, Simpson! Crisis brings out the best in you.
-What is it, Bart? -Nothing.
Must.
Take.
Test.
-What's the matter, son? -Stabbing pains in my stomach.
Oh, dear, I've heard of this.
-Do you feel pain in your arm? -Both arms.
-Temporary loss of vision? -Who said that? Come closer.
Yes, dear? Maybe one more dish.
Make it cappuccino chocolate fudge.
Your third bowl.
I think you're on the mend.
Anything else I can get you? -Perhaps the TV? -Of course.
Homer! What? Bring the TV up.
Bart's got his vision back! I wish I had amoria phlebitis.
-I know you're faking it.
-Keep your mouth shut.
-You'll still fail that test.
-I've got my bases covered.
Milhouse, what'd I miss today? Richard laughed milk through his nose.
What about that history test? Piece of cake? What'd you get for number one? Number two? Yeah, that sounds right.
Here you go, Mrs.
Krabappel.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.
This test is worse than Milhouse's! Bart, I warned you.
This is the final straw! You know our district psychiatrist, Dr.
J.
Loren Pryor.
Hey, Dr.
J.
This is a classic case of what laymen refer to as "fear of failure.
" Bart is an underachiever, yet he seems to be.
How should I put this? Proud of it.
One of his problems is a short attention span.
Blah, blah, blah.
Bart failed his last four exams.
Is there anything you haven't told us? Everyone else in the class has shown some improvement.
-Yet you continue to struggle.
Why? -I don't know.
Look at these results: 55, 42, 26.
A 12 on state capitals! Why are we dancing around the obvious? We all know it.
I'm dumb as a post.
-Think I'm happy? -You're just a late bloomer.
It isn't that simple.
As emotionally crippling as it may be, my recommendation is for Bart to repeat the fourth grade.
-You can't! I'll do better! -That'll be the day.
Maybe it would help him to be left back.
It won't be so bad.
You can't hold me back.
I swear I'll do better.
Look in my eyes.
See the sincerity? See the fear? As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade! If not, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids.
Get off the bus and forever hold your peace, little dudes.
Otto, I respect you.
You let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus.
Damn thing never goes over, does it? So what's in your head? I've been failing a lot of tests recently.
They'll hold me back if I don't shape up.
That's it? Relax, man.
It could be the best thing to happen to you.
I got held back in the fourth grade.
Twice.
And look at me, man.
Now I drive the school bus! My recommendation is for Bart to repeat the fourth grade.
All right, class, the topic is world literature.
What was the pirate's name in Treasure Island, Bart Simpson? I got a peptic ulcer, my wife wants a new car and I need a root canal.
-Quit bugging me about the pirate.
-Long John Silver, Dad.
I heard that, Bart Jr.
I want to see both of you after class.
Thanks a lot, son.
Yo, little help! I said little help.
Throw me the ball, Poindexter.
I'm sorry, Bart.
I don't know the rules of your sport.
I didn't want to interfere with a ball in play.
Back to the forecastle of the Pequod.
-Hey, Martin.
-I have nothing of value.
Help me get a passing grade.
You need someone's help, but I don't know why that someone should be me.
I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you.
They laugh at me? I'd always considered myself rather popular.
You're not.
Watch.
My speed with numbers, my years as a hall monitor my prize-winning dioramas, they mean nothing to them? Perhaps another demonstration.
-Very well, you've made your point.
-Then it's a deal? Yes.
-Let's have a look at your study area.
-Study area? Your sanctuary from the frenzy of modern life.
There's a desk under that junk.
No, this won't do at all.
We have to clean up this room.
And we'll need a fern.
No room is complete without plant life.
No.
Geeks sit in the front.
From now on, you sit in the back row.
That goes for school and church too.
-Why? -So no one can see what you're doing.
I understand.
Mischief varies inversely with proximity to the authority figure.
Yeah, but don't say it like that.
Soon you'll be ready to try it with a real book.
Pushing a boy into the girls' lavatory was such a thrill! The screams, the humiliation, the fact that it wasn't me! -I've never felt so alive.
-Now, the test is tomorrow-- Who cares about some test? Life's too short! I thought we had a deal.
The old Martin no longer exists.
Come on, fellows, to the arcade! Cool, Martin! Martin! Martin! Martin! -Bart, it's past your bedtime.
-Okay.
This is hopeless.
This is the end of the road.
I haven't always been a good kid.
But if I go to school tomorrow, I'll fail and be held back.
I need one more day to study, Lord.
I need your help.
Prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel.
A teacher strike, a power failure.
Anything that'll cancel school.
I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can.
Thanking you in advance, your pal, Bart Simpson.
Wake up, Bart.
Rise and shine, little guy.
Oh, no.
Wake up and look at the snow.
Whoa! Good morning, world! It's the Bill and Marty Show.
-He's Bill.
-He's Marty.
We can't get enough of each other.
We've got snow-formation for you flake lovers.
The gas and water plants are closed.
And the nuclear power plant.
That's closed too.
All right! Now, for all you youngsters, here it is.
Springfield county schools are-- Oh, I'm too excited! Springfield schools will be closed! All right! Come back, you're supposed to eat breakfast! Cowabunga! Remember to take a break if your arms go numb! Last night, you prayed for this.
Now your prayers have been answered.
I don't know who or what God is exactly.
But he's more powerful than Mom and Dad put together.
And you owe him big.
You're right.
I asked for a miracle, and I got it.
I gotta study.
I'm not missing anything.
Frozen ears.
Trudging up that stupid sled hill over and over.
How good could it be? I haven't had this much fun in years.
Gotcha, Burnsie.
I was never one to back away from a snowball fight.
-Smithers, fire at will.
-Certainly.
I hereby declare this day to be Snow Day the funnest day in the history of Springfield! Gotta study, gotta study! "Four Days in Philadelphia.
" The first Congress faced a difficult job.
"Could they make decisions that Americans could support?" We hold these truths to be self-evident.
We hold these truths to be self-evident.
That all men are created equal.
That from that equal creation, they derive rights-- Look, everybody! It's snowing! -In the middle of July? -It's a miracle.
I've invented something fun.
The sled.
Look, John Hancock's writing his name in the snow! Do you want to be held back a grade? Concentrate, man! Later, Mrs.
K.
Please turn in your exam, Bart.
Class is over.
-Could you grade it now? -Well, all right.
Let me get Old Red.
It's a 59.
That's another F.
Oh, no, I can't believe it.
I know.
Another year together.
It's gonna be hell.
What's the matter? I thought you'd be used to failing.
No, you don't understand.
I tried this time.
I really tried.
There, there.
This is as good as I can do, and I still failed.
Well, a 59.
It's a high F.
Who am I kidding? I really am a failure.
Now I know how Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity in 1754.
You know, 1754.
The famous defeat to the French.
-My God, Bart, you're right! -So? You demonstrated applied knowledge.
Such an obscure reference deserves an extra point.
It's only fair.
-You mean I passed? -Just barely.
I passed.
I got a D minus! I passed! All right! I passed! I passed! I passed! I got a D minus! I got a D minus! I passed! I got a D minus! I passed! l-- Kissed the teacher?! We're proud of you.
Thanks, Dad, but part of this D minus belongs to God.

The capital of North Dakota is named after what German ruler? -Hitler! -North Dakota? Bismarck.
-Hitler? -I'm still beating you, boy.
The colors of the Italian flag are red, white and what? -Blue.
Red.
-Green.
Black, green.
-Green.
-I was right! We'll be right back with more Grade School Challenge.
I used to think hair loss was inevitable.
I found Dimoxinil, the breakthrough in hair regrowth.
Breakthrough? There's been a breakthrough?! Dimoxinil can help me grow as much or as little hair as I want to.
Hey, today I'm gonna do it.
For your free brochure, send $5 to Dimoxinil.
Hair.
Hair.
Just like everybody else.
Some women find bald men quite virile.
Weren't you listening? This is a breakthrough.
Not one of these cheap-o sucker deals.
Allow me to present the Dimoxinil action set.
A six-month supply of the drug, gravity boots, scalp massager and a T-shirt.
-Great.
How much? -$1000.
A thousand bucks? I can't afford that! We do have a product which is more in your price range.
However, any hair growth while using it will be coincidental.
A thousand bucks.
Of all the rip-off screw job, cheap joint.
Forget you, pal.
Thanks for nothing.
So I say, "Forget you, pal.
Thanks for nothing.
" -I storm right out.
-That's telling them.
Out of tartar sauce.
They call this a portion? Are you gonna use your sauce? Dry fish sticks! This sucks.
-Stop whining, chrome dome.
-lf I had hair, you wouldn't say that.
Homer, don't be a sap.
Fill out some insurance forms.
Charge Dimoxinil to the company.
It's $1000.
Burns would can my butt.
Oh, $1000.
So what? So he has one less ivory back scratcher.
You pay into the insurance fund.
What do you get? Nothing.
The newsletter.
Why get nothing while a guy who loses a finger hits the jackpot? You got me.
I'd like to charge that Dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance.
I don't know who put you up to this but no insurance plan covers something as frivolous as Dimoxinil! Meet me in the alley in 15 minutes.
Come alone.
Dear God, give a bald guy a break.
Amen.
I have hair.
I have hair! I have hair! Look, look! Morning, Springfield.
Morning, Mr.
and Mrs.
Winfield.
Get a haircut, you hippie! -Good morning, Moe's Tavern! -It's the president.
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning.
Good morning, everybody! Good morning, Springfield! Dimoxinil! Homer Simpson! You haven't been here in 20 years.
-You got rid of the sideburns.
-Give me the usual.
He's much happier at work.
Just between us girls, he hasn't been this frisky in years.
-I don't want to think about it.
-Daddy's home, sugar.
Come here, you.
Homie, my sisters are here.
Dinner with three beautiful women.
I must be in heaven.
This is Homer? -Patty, stop drooling.
-Look who's talking.
You look different, Homer.
Lose weight? You got a tan.
I know what it is, a new tie.
Pathetic morons in my employ, stealing my precious money.
None of these cretins deserves a promotion.
It's in the union contract.
One token promotion per year.
Wait.
Who is that young go-getter? Looks like Homer Simpson, only more dynamic and resourceful.
Simpson? An unspoiled lump of clay to mold in my own image.
Our new junior executive! Bring him to me.
Homer Simpson, you've been promoted.
You're now an executive.
Take three minutes to say goodbye and report to room 503 for reassignment to a better life.
Your "resume" seems in order.
Do you have any specialties? Backrubs for harried executives.
I'll show you.
No, that will be fine.
Thank you, goodbye.
-Hello.
-How's my big, important executive? Oh, Marge.
Every woman I interview makes kissy faces at me.
Hello, Mr.
Simpson.
I'm Karl.
-Hire him.
-I'll call you back.
Meeting in the board room tomorrow at 2.
-Sit there and keep your mouth shut.
-Yes.
He thinks he's so big.
You don't belong here.
You don't belong here.
You're a fraud and a phony, and they'll find you out.
-Who told you? -You did.
With the way you talk into your chest the way you smother yourself in lime-green polyester.
I want you to say to yourself, "I deserve this.
I love it.
I am nature's greatest miracle.
" Go ahead, say it.
Trust me, Homer.
-Say it! -I deserve it.
-Louder.
-I deserve it! -Shout it.
-I am nature's greatest miracle! -Three weeks' vacation plus expenses.
-You got it! Let's go shopping.
Beauty.
A man's suit should make him a prince.
It should cry out: "Here I am.
Don't judge me, love me.
" -Do any of these suits do that? -No.
I like this.
No, no.
Stand naturally, Mr.
Simpson.
Let it all hang out.
You, conceal it.
-Mom and Dad have been kissing.
-Gotta run.
-Happy anniversary, Homer.
-Our anniversary, are you sure? Don't worry, this year you have an excuse.
-With your job and-- -Happy anniversary.
Homer! -Hello? -Mr.
Simpson, it's Karl.
Sounds like everything's arrived.
Wonderful.
-You did this? -I didn't overstep my bounds? -I love you, Homer! -I love you, Karl-- Marge.
-Proceed, Smithers.
-Our first issue is low productivity -and high accident rate.
-Any suggestions? -A round of layoffs.
-Caffeine in the water cooler.
Those are my ideas.
You people don't think! I promoted someone in touch with workers.
-You! -You mean him.
You.
How would you improve the situation? Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem with fish sticks at lunch.
-What are you talking about? -They chop up the fish into sticks-- I know what they are! Get to the point.
You only get this tiny cup of sauce, and I always run out.
-Stop wasting our time.
-Shut up! Can't you see? A happy worker is a busy worker.
Three cents' worth of sauce could save us hours in labor.
I like the cut of your jib.
Let the fools have their tartar sauce.
Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys.
Give me your plate.
Don't crowd.
Plenty for everybody! Brilliant! Who could've imagined that reforms would pay off so quickly? Accidents decreased by the number Simpson is known to have caused.
Output is just as high during his last holiday.
My dear, tired old Smithers.
Do I detect a note of jealousy? It is time.
Give Simpson the key.
Don't sit on that filthy thing one second longer.
They've given you the key.
The key! Stunning.
Absolutely stunning.
I was watching the DuMont last night and I caught a documentary on Rommel.
A man who got things done.
Towel, Simpson.
-Allow me.
-I said Simpson.
Sure thing, Mr.
Burns.
Well done, Simpson.
Now, walk behind me.
Can do, sir.
" $1000.
Dimoxinil.
To keep brain from freezing.
" Now I've got you, Simpson.
Between your hair care and wardrobe, we're not saving for a rainy day.
Rainy day? There's never gonna be one.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
What does my little girl want? An absence of mood swings and stability in my life.
-How about a pony? -Okay! I want you to weave your magic with my executives.
-A short speech, "Work.
Work.
Work.
" -Okay.
Excellent.
Set you to your task, Simpson.
It's my sad duty to report an executive has bilked you out of $1000.
What? Blast his hide to Hades! And I was going to buy that ivory backscratcher.
-How? -He charged Dimoxinil.
-It's a baldness cure.
-Thank you, professor.
I know what it is.
Make an example of this hooligan.
With pleasure, sir.
You've got to help me.
Mr.
Burns wants me to make a speech.
-What do you want? -I came by to tell you you're fired.
Our company doesn't look kindly upon insurance fraud.
Clean out your desk by noon.
Wait, Mr.
Smithers.
Homer Simpson is innocent.
I did this.
What are you saying? Mr.
Simpson was unaware.
I take full responsibility.
Really? Well then, you're fired.
Whoever you are.
Here's your $1000.
-What do you care if this guy's bald? -My reasons are my own.
Karl, you saved me.
Why? Have I done something extraordinary here today? No.
I did what any soldier would do when a grenade threatens his commander.
I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt.
Thanks, Karl.
I don't know what to say.
Just walk me to my car.
-Bye, Karl.
I'm gonna miss you.
-Bye, Mr.
Simpson.
-Did you bring an umbrella today? -D'oh! No.
Here.
You're broke.
You don't have Karl.
He's not here.
But you've got your hair.
Oh, that big speech! -Hey, what's happening, hepcats? -No way.
It's gotta be a fake.
It's like reals-ville, daddy-o.
What are you doing? You little--! Now I've got you! Boy must die! I love you, Dad.
Dirty trick.
I won't kill you.
But I'll tell you three things that will haunt you forever.
You've ruined me, you've crippled your family and baldness is hereditary! It is? -Why don't you call the pharmacy? -I don't have $1000! But you do.
You've been squirreling it away.
Saving it for a rainy day, right? Dad's taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
Oh, Homie.
I'm so sorry.
Got that speech in five minutes.
You're not going to hang yourself? Dear Mr.
Simpson I've prepared your speech on 3-by-5 cards.
-The big words are spelled phonetically.
-"Phonetically.
" God bless you.
You are one of Springfield's special creatures.
Your obedient servant, Karl.
Good luck, sir.
That wasn't just a voice inside my head.
-Why are you here? -I came to say bye to the gals.
Thanks for the speech.
But I can't give it.
Look at me.
-I haven't taught you anything! -What? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key, drying your boss's hands.
It was never the hair.
You did it, because you believed you could.
-I'm a big fool.
-No, you're not.
-How do you know? -Mother taught me never to kiss a fool.
-Karl.
-Now go get them, tiger.
And now with some insights, one of the stars of our nuclear family Homer Simpson.
Who is that old geezer? What's he done with Homer Simpson? He is Homer Simpson, sir.
You'd think I was crazy if I did this.
-He's crazy! -Yet this company does this every day.
Bloated inventory, outmoded production methods.
I can save this company millions a year.
How? Jiko Kanri, the art of self-management.
-This bald man has no ideas.
-lf it's a joke, I'm not laughing.
Telling us how to run things.
He doesn't have hair.
Mining uranium that could be purchased on foreign markets.
The long-term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost, for a net savings of $5-- Lots of money.
Mr.
Burns' office, right now.
Dead man coming through.
Well, well.
Our dashing, young junior executive.
You made a mockery of our meeting.
I should fire you on the spot! -But I'm not going to.
-Why? -How old do you think I am? -I don't know.
102? I'm only 81.
You may find this hard to believe, but in my salad days my glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls.
I was big man on campus until my senior year when I became as bald as a plucked chicken.
I too know the sting of male pattern baldness.
That's why I'm giving you your old job back.
What? Oh, thank you.
Get out of here before I reconsider.
Better hurry up.
-Are you still awake? -I've never been more awake in my life.
-What's wrong? -Are you kidding? I'm stuck in a dead-end job again.
The kids will hate me because I can't buy the stuff I promised.
And you're not going to love me because I'm ugly and bald.
Oh, Homer.
Your job has always put food on our table.
-And the kids will get over it.
-And? What about loving me? -Oh, Homer.
Come here.
-What? Come here.

Hello, everyone.
You know, Halloween is a strange holiday.
I don't understand it.
Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils things on TV that are inappropriate for children.
Things like the next half-hour.
Nothing bothers my kids.
But tonight's show, which I wash my hands of, is really scary.
If you have sensitive kids, maybe you should tuck them into bed instead of writing us angry letters.
Thanks for your attention.
Tree House of Horror What a haul this year.
I love Halloween.
Wait a minute.
Let's see what the kids are up to.
And the policeman on the phone said: "We traced the call.
It's coming from the floor below you! Get out!" But it was too late.
End of story.
I heard that in the third grade.
It's not scary.
-Is too.
-Is not.
-Is too.
-Is not.
-Fine! Then you tell one scarier.
-Flashlight, please.
-Here's a story that's scarifying.
-Oh, brother.
I call it, "Bad Dream House.
" -That's all.
Sign here.
-There you are.
-And a dollar for you.
-A buck.
-I'm glad there's a curse here.
-Huh? Well, it's all ours! -I can't believe how cheap it was.
-Motivated seller.
Well, he must have been motivated.
Prime location, 18 rooms, moat.
We shouldn't be able to afford this.
So we got a deal for once.
Quit fighting it.
It just seems too good to be true.
Mom! Bart threw a book at me.
-Did not! -Did too! Get out.
-What on earth was that? -Oh, just the house settling.
This kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch.
-Homer! What's this in the corner? -I don't know.
Looks like a vortex.
A gateway into another dimension.
Ooh, a vortex.
Catch! Hey, pretty slick.
"Quit throwing garbage into our dimension.
" Mom! Dad! Help! Get out! Okay, boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.
I can feel an evil presence in here.
-Evil? -Quiet.
You're scaring your mother.
Children, get your coats.
We're leaving right now.
Wait.
It's only natural there would be things wrong with a home like this.
It's a fixer-upper.
What's the problem? We get some priests-- I won't live in this evil house just to save money.
Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars.
We're talking a few thousand dollars! It's got great high ceilings! Tell you what.
Let's sleep on it.
Okay? -All right.
If anything happens-- -What could happen? They are all against you, Bart.
You must kill them all.
They all must die.
-Are you my conscience? -I'm-- Yes, I am.
Lisa.
Lisa.
The butcher knife, Lisa.
They are all against me.
They all must die.
Marge.
Oh, Marge.
I'm in the kitchen, Homer.
Die! Die! Everybody die! What's going on out here? -Homer! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Stop it! -Sorry, Dad.
-Sorry, Bart.
-Sorry, Mom.
We're leaving.
-You said you'd sleep on it.
-I don't care.
This family has had its differences but we've never had knife fights.
I blame this house.
Mom! Dad! Look! -It's an ancient Indian burial ground.
-Man, this place has everything! An ancient Indian what? Mr.
Plott? Homer Simpson here.
When you sold me the house you didn't mention one thing.
You didn't tell me it was built on an Indian burial ground! No, you didn't! That's not my recollection! Yeah? Well, all right.
Goodbye.
-He says he mentioned it.
-Let's go, kids.
-Ah, Marge.
-Homer! You will die.
You will die slowly.
Your stomach will swell.
Your intestines will writhe and boil.
Your eyes will burst and some horrible stuff possibly your brains, will start coming out through your nose.
Shush! Shut up! Quit trying to push us around! Stop saying those horrible things and show some manners! Look.
I've never been so angry.
My hands are shaking.
Better than your eyes bursting.
-Do it again.
-What? -Make the walls bleed.
-No.
We own you.
Let's see some blood.
-I don't have to entertain you.
-Do it! Do the blood thing.
Come on! Do it! Do it! Do it! Why are you scaring us? To keep us from getting close -and maybe even loving you? -Leave me alone.
Don't talk that way.
-Hey, listen, lady-- -Oh, don't call me lady.
My name is Marge Simpson, and we're not going anywhere.
We're going to have to live together, so you better get used to it.
Please.
-Can I think about this? -Sure.
Life with the Simpsons.
What choice do I have? -Wow! -Bitchen! It destroyed itself rather than live with us.
You can't help but feel a little rejected.
-That wasn't scary.
-Oh, yeah? Well, how about this severed finger! Eww! Baby spit! Well, that last story was a warmup for this macabre tale I call: "Hungry Are the Damned.
" -Homer, all these flies.
-Not to worry.
I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
Ooh! That was a big mama.
That should do it.
Man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection.
Cool, man! The burgers are getting cold, guys-- Holy moly.
Huh? Greetings, Earthlings.
I am Kang.
Do not be frightened.
We mean you no harm.
-You speak English.
-I'm speaking Rigelian.
By coincidence, our languages are exactly the same.
-What are you gonna do with us? -We're taking you to Rigel Four.
A world of infinite delights to tantalize your senses and challenge your intellect.
Look.
To you, we Simpsons are a lower order of life.
We face that prejudice every day, but we are happy on our planet.
We throw ourselves on your mercy.
Please return-- -Dinner! -Get a load of that spread.
Here you go.
Take all you want, but eat all you take.
Thank you, Mr--? To pronounce it correctly, I would have to pull out your tongue.
-Fried shrimp.
-Sloppy joes.
-Smothered pork chops.
-Look! Radish rosettes.
These are hard to make.
They're an advanced race.
Come, Earthlings, eat.
Grow large with food.
Something's not quite right.
The girl's right.
Let's get some applesauce for these pork chops! -What are you looking at, buddy? -Your wife's quite a dish.
Thanks.
It's our pleasure to provide you with entertainment on your journey.
We get over a million channels from the far reaches of the galaxy.
-Do you get HBO? -No.
That's extra.
Here's our achievement in amusement technology.
An electronic version of table tennis.
-Your paddles have been replaced-- -That's just Pong! -Get with the times, man.
-We played that before marriage.
We did build this spaceship.
Anyone that has mastered intergalactic travel, raise your hand.
-All right, then.
-Sorry.
Your game is very nice.
-Dinnertime.
-How come you guys never eat? Oh, we wouldn't want to spoil our appetite for the feast when we land on Rigel Four.
-Ooh, a feast.
-Will we be invited? Oh, you'll be at the feast.
I have a feeling you'll be the guests of honor.
-Tell us more about this feast.
-No, eat now.
When we arrive, there will be plenty of time to chew the fat.
Very good, Earth boy.
Excellent, Mr.
Simpson.
Excellent.
This will give the humans the perfect flavor.
Stop! Don't you see what's happening? They're fattening us up so they can eat us! -Lisa.
-Oh, come on, Lisa.
If you don't believe me, look at this book I found.
-She's right.
-You have stopped eating.
Listen, you big stupid space creature! Nobody, but nobody, eats the Simpsons.
-I beg your pardon? -We found your book.
You mean this? It's a harmless cookbook.
It's just a little dusty.
Wait a minute.
Wait, there's still more space dust on here.
-Let me get this straight.
-They thought we would eat them.
-Good God! Is this some kind of joke? -No, they're serious.
Why were you making us eat? Make you eat? We merely provided a banquet and you made pigs of yourselves.
I slaved in the kitchen for days for you people and-- Well, if you wanted to make Serak cry, mission accomplished.
You aren't the only beings who have emotions, you know.
We offered you paradise.
You would have experienced emotions greater than what you call love greater than what you call fun.
You would have been treated like gods and lived forever in beauty.
But, now, because of your distrustful nature, that can never be.
For a superior race, they really rub it in.
There were monsters on that ship, and we were them.
See why we say you're too smart for your own good? -Way to go, Lis.
-Yeah, thanks, Lisa.
Hello, something scary happening.
Hey, it's Halloween.
Put the book away.
For your information, I'm about to read a tale by Edgar Allan Poe.
-Wait.
That's a schoolbook.
-Don't worry, you won't learn anything.
It's called, The Raven.
Once upon a midnight dreary While I pondered Weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious Volume of forgotten lore I nodded, nearly napping Suddenly there came a tapping As of someone gently rapping At my chamber door -Just some visitor-- -I muttered Tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more -Are we scared yet? -Bart, he's establishing mood.
Ah, distinctly I remember It is in the bleak December Each dying ember wrought Its ghost on the floor Eagerly I wished The morrow Vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow Sorrow for the lost Lenore Oh, Lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden Whom angels name Lenore Nameless here For evermore The silken sad uncertain rustling Of each curtain thrilled me Filled me with fantastic terrors Never felt before To still my beating heart I stood repeating A visitor at my chamber door And nothing more My soul grew stronger Hesitating then no longer -Sir-- -Said I Or Madam, truly your Forgiveness I implore I was napping, and you came rapping And so faintly you came tapping Tapping at my chamber door That I scarce was sure I heard you Here I opened Wide the door This better be good.
Darkness there and nothing more You know what's scarier? -What? -Anything! Back into the chamber turning My soul within me burning Soon again I heard tapping Something louder than before -Surely-- -Said I Something at My window lattice Let me see what thereat is And this mystery explore I flung a shutter With a flirt and flutter In stepped a Raven Of the days of yore No obeisance made he Not a minute stayed he Mien of lord or lady Perched above my door Perched upon a bust Just above my door Perched and sat And nothing more -Thy crest be shorn and shaven-- -I said Art sure no craven, ghastly ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore -Tell me what thy name is-- -Quoth the Raven -Eat my shorts! -He says, "Nevermore.
" -And that's all he'll ever say.
-Okay.
Okay.
Then methought The air grew denser -Perfumed by some unseen censer -Stupid censer.
Swung by Seraphim Whose foot tinkled on the floor -Wretch-- -I cried God lent thee By angels sent thee Respite from thy Memories of Lenore Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe And forget this lost Lenore -Quoth the Raven-- -Nevermore -Be that word our sign of parting-- -I shrieked up starting Get thee into the tempest And the night's Plutonian shore Leave no black plume as a token Of the lie thy soul hath spoken Leave my loneliness unbroken Quit the bust above my door Take thy beak from out my heart And take thy form from off my door -Quoth the Raven-- -Nevermore Take thy beak from out my heart And take thy form from off my door Quoth the Raven -Nevermore -Why you little-- Come back here, you little raven! Nevermore, nevermore Nevermore The Raven never flitting Still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust Just above my chamber door His eyes have the seeming Of a demon that is dreaming The lamplight o'er him streaming Throws his shadow on the floor My soul from out that shadow That lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted Nevermore Lisa, that wasn't scary.
Not even for a poem.
It was written in 1845.
Maybe people were easier to scare.
Like Friday the 13th Part I.
It's pretty tame by today's standards.
Children, bedtime! I guess I'll have no trouble getting to sleep tonight.
Oh, no, Marge.
Come on, please.
I'm not sleeping with the lights on.
They're just children's stories.
They can't hurt you.
Oh, I hate Halloween!

-So, kids, caught anything? -Not yet, sir.
-What do you use for bait? -My brother's using worms but I feel tranquility outweighs catching fish and use nothing.
-I see.
What's your name? -Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you? I'm Dave Shutton.
I'm a reporter who's on the road a lot.
In my day, we didn't talk that way to elders.
Well, this is my day, and we do, sir.
All right! We eat tonight! Wait a minute.
One.
Two.
Three.
Leave it to old Mary Bailey to finally do something about that hideous mutation.
Mary Bailey! If I was governor -I'd find better things to do.
-Such as? Getting Washington and Lincoln's birthdays as separate holidays.
President's Day! What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and-- -You're late.
-Someone will punch in for me.
Don't spill anything.
-Keep the mutants coming! -I'll mutant you.
Oh, man! Plain cake donuts.
Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys! Why can't I ever get here on time? Hi-ho, faceless employees.
In a few moments, the government inspection team will be here so look busy and keep quiet! That's all.
Very stirring, sir.
Here they come.
Hold me, Smithers.
Okay.
Geiger counters on.
That's normal background radiation.
You'd find it in any nuclear facility -or for that matter, hospitals.
-Sorry.
Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower.
I'm as shocked as you.
-Plutonium rod used as paperweight.
-Now that shouldn't be.
Yeah, well, that's always been like that.
-Just resting my eyes! -Well done.
A rested employee is a vigilant employee.
Monitoring station unmanned.
Look here, inspector, could I speak to you privately in my office? Mr.
Burns, in 20 years, I have never seen such a shoddy, deplorable-- Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands of dollars just lying here on my table.
Smithers, why don't we leave and hopefully, when we return, the pile of money will be gone.
The money and a stupid man are still here.
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to bribe me.
Is there some confusion about this? Take it! Take it, you poor schmo! Mr.
Burns! I'm gonna overlook this felony.
However, I will not overlook the 342 violations I have observed today.
Either bring this place up to code, or we'll shut it down.
Good day.
Oh, well.
A little dab of paint here, a little spackle there.
How much could it possibly cost to fix this place up? -Approximately $56 million.
-56 million?! -Don't hit me, sir.
-Oh, that I had the strength to.
Now please go.
I would be alone.
Empty.
Just resting my eyes! Holy moly! 9:30.
Hi, Marge.
Sorry I didn't call, but it's been a madhouse here! Yeah, these 12-hour days are killing me.
Echo! Mr.
Burns? Sorry, sir.
It's me, Homer Simpson.
-Is everything all right? -Working late, Simpson? -Yes, sir.
-You and I are a dying breed.
I'll share something with you.
Hop in.
Cushy! They're trying to shut us down.
They say we're contaminating the planet.
-Well, nobody's perfect.
-Can't they just get off our backs? If I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.
You know how much it costs to run for office? -More than any honest man can afford! -I bet you could.
Don't get me wrong.
You're an honest man.
I just meant you could afford to run for governor.
I'm just rambling because you keep staring at me, but it's true.
If you were governor, you could decide what's safe.
-Where are we going, sir? -To create a new and better world.
If it's on the way, could you drop me at my house? -He's got my vote.
-Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.
Mary Bailey won't fire me if I don't vote for her.
I'm for Burns! A political discussion at our table.
I feel like a Kennedy! I don't see how that despicable man has a chance against Mary Bailey our state's most beloved governor.
Now, here's the problem as I see it.
While Bailey is beloved by all 98 percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse.
So we got the finest campaign team money can buy.
This is your speech writer, joke writer, spin doctor makeup man and personal trainer.
Their job: to turn this Mr.
Burns, into this.
Why are my teeth showing like that? -Because you're smiling! -Excellent! This is the kind of trickery I'm paying you for.
How do we turn Joe Six-pack against Mary Bailey? With this team.
Your muckraker, character assassin -mudslinger, garbologist.
-Hello.
Their job is to turn Mary Bailey from this, into this.
Visual aids help so much.
Thanks.
But first there's a burning issue that we need to neutralize.
I hate that fish! Thank you for watching Movie for a Dreary Afternoon.
Next, a political announcement from the friends of Montgomery Burns.
-Burns? Change it.
-You do it.
I did it last week.
Fine.
Be a jerk.
We'll just sit here and watch it.
Oh, no! An election? That's when they close the bars, isn't it? Sorry, Barney.
I wonder if he'll talk about that fish.
Oh, Marge.
I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.
-Thirty seconds.
-Remember to smile.
-I am smiling.
-You'll have to do better than that.
-How's this? -There you go! -I'll be sore tomorrow.
-We've done all we can.
-The rest is up to you.
-Don't worry.
When this announcement's done every Johnny Lunch-pail in this state will be eating out of my hand.
Hello, friends.
I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor.
I'm here to talk to you about my little friend Blinky.
Many of you think he's a a hideous mutation.
That simply isn't true.
Don't take my word for it.
Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin.
-Hello.
-Hello, Charles.
Tell them about your theory of natural selection.
Glad to.
Every so often, Mother Nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs or in this case, a third eye.
If these changes are an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the earth.
So this fish might have an advantage over other fish.
It may be a kind of super-fish.
I wouldn't mind a third eye, would you? No.
You see, friends if our antinuclear naysayers and choose-upsiders came upon an elephant next to our power plant they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman.
This fish is a miracle of nature, with a taste that can't be beat.
So say what you want about me, I can take the slings and arrows.
But stop slandering poor, defenseless Blinky.
Good night and God bless.
Only a moron wouldn't cast his vote For Monty Burns Wow! Super-fish! I wish the government would get off his back.
That Burns is just what this state needs, young blood! I hope we can count on your support.
-Homer, I'm a Bailey booster.
-Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns booster.
Congratulations, Mr.
Burns, the polls show you're up six points.
-Giving me a total of? -Six.
We're on our way.
My worthy opponent seems to think that the voters are gullible fools.
I'll rely on their intelligence and good judgment.
Interesting.
Good luck.
And I say taxes are too high! Have you found any dirt on Mary Bailey? -We went through her trash.
-Talked to her maid.
The only dirt we've got is from a guy who dated her at 16.
-And? -He felt her up.
Not good enough! We're gonna send a message to those bureaucrats down there in the state capital! -Is your boss governor yet? -Not yet, son.
Not yet.
-The voters see you as godlike.
-Hot dog! But the downside is you're losing touch with the common man.
-Oh, dear! Heaven forefend! -So the night before the election we want you to eat at the home of one of your workers.
I see.
Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this godforsaken state will see me chow down with Eddie Punchclock.
The media will have a field day.
The only question is, can we find someone common enough? Well, I knew there would be sacrifices.
Great toast, Marge! Oh, by the way, the night before the election -Mr.
Burns is coming to dinner.
-What!? -And some camera crews.
-Cool, man! A media circus! -Absolutely not! -Come on, Marge! I'm ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey.
Kids, please leave.
I don't want you to see this.
Please, please, please, please! We'd like one of the children to ask a question.
Can you memorize this? "Your campaign's moving like a runaway freight train.
-Why are you so popular?" -Very good.
Can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet and making it uninhabitable? -The card question's fine.
-I think her question is valid-- Don't worry.
I'm sure she'll be able to memorize it by tomorrow.
Finally, Mr.
Burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him but remember, he hates being touched.
-Marge, get back in bed.
-No, I'm fine right here.
-I just wanna snuggle.
-I don't feel like snuggling.
-What's that got to do with it? -You don't let me express myself.
You express yourself in the home you keep and the food you serve.
Okay, Homer.
Fair enough.
You got it.
All right.
Good.
That's how I'm going to express myself.
Good night.
-Well, what do we think? -Hey! Hello, handsome! Get that off his face.
We're eating with the common man, not Tyrone Power.
Latest polls are in.
It's dead even: 50-50.
This stunt will put us over the top.
He's here! Hello, Homer.
Marge, you look dazzling! And look, I've brought noodle kugel.
You bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up.
I love dogs.
Babies too.
-Kitty, kitty.
-Are you all right, Mr.
Burns? Of course.
A little roughhousing with the pets is good for the appetite.
The way you handled the pets put you over the top.
You're ahead 5 1 to 49.
Congratulations, Mr.
Governor.
-Excellent.
-Bart, would you say grace? God, we paid for all this ourselves, so thanks for nothing.
Only a child could get away with such blasphemy.
God bless them all.
Amen.
He's smokin'.
You know, Mr.
Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high.
Where do you stand on this controversial issue? I didn't realize this was going to turn into a charged political debate.
-I was only reading-- -I agree.
If I am elected governor I'll lower taxes whether bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not! Lisa, do you have a question for Uncle Montgomery? Yes, sir.
A very inane one.
Your campaign's moving like a runaway freight train.
-Why are you so popular? -A tough question, but a fair one.
There's no single answer.
Some voters respond to my integrity others to my incorruptibility and determination to lower taxes and the bureaucrats can put that in their pipes and smoke it! -Oh, Mom, that felt awful.
-I'm sorry.
It will all be over soon.
But we've become the tools of evil.
You're learning lessons tonight and one of them is to give your mother the benefit of the doubt.
--or even a square deal.
Smells delightful.
-All right! Three-eyed fish! -Can I have your plate? -I don't believe it! -He's blown it! Ruined before it hit the ground.
Here's your headline, "Burns Can't Swallow Own Story.
" Burns' popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish.
You must have a few tricks left up your sleeve.
Make coffee.
We're not licked yet.
-Yes, we are.
Come on.
-Wait! Come back! You can't do this to me! I'm Charles Montgomery Burns! -Smithers, tip over this table.
-Yes, sir.
Make them stop.
Mr.
Burns.
Shut up and wreck something! I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions will accomplish.
She's right.
Take me home, Smithers.
We'll destroy something tasteful.
Ironic.
This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes cost me the election, but if I had them killed I'd be the one to go to jail.
That's democracy.
You're poetic in defeat, sir.
Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled.
You're busted, Dad.
My dreams will go unfulfilled? I don't like the sound of that.
That means I have nothing to hope for.
Marge, can't you make it better? When a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert occasional snuggling and sleeping in on weekends no one man can destroy them.
Hey, you did it!

-So, what happened in Capital City? -Oh, Barney.
We're dying of curiosity.
The only thing worse than being a loser is being a guy telling the story of how he became a loser.
-I don't want that to happen to me.
-Please, Homer? Well, okay.
It was "Nuclear Plant Employee, Spouses and No-More-Than-Three-Kids Night" down at Springfield Stadium.
I think we lost them.
And we're at the ballpark! All right! Two birds with one stone! Okay, everybody out! Some of the players you see may make it to the big leagues.
-Will we see washed-up major leaguers? -Sure, there's a nice mix.
There's no better place to spend a balmy summers' night.
The grass of the outfield, the brick of the infield and the chalk lines that divide the man from the boy.
Lisa, you're forgetting the beer.
It comes in 72-ounce tubs.
-Space out the tubs this year.
-What do you mean? Last year you got rambunctious and mooned the umpire.
Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat.
It also gives me the right, no, the duty to make a complete ass of myself.
The Gammills! Good to see you.
You're an inspiration to us in Waste Management.
Forget about contaminants for one night and have a hot dog.
-Put a smile on his card, Smithers.
-Already there, sir.
-The Simpsons, sir.
-Well, if it isn't the Simps.
Oh, the Simpsons, sir.
Oh, yes.
Homer and Marge Simpson.
Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and Expecting.
The card needs to be updated, sir.
That's okay.
The baby's name isn't important.
Let's go.
Red Hots! Get your Red Hots here! Flash Bailor! I gotta get his autograph.
He was a star.
-Will you sign my ball? -No.
Lousy, washed-up, broken-down tub of guts! -Who does he think he is? -What's wrong? -He won't sign my ball.
-He's a fine role model.
Bart, give me that ball.
Check out the mature quail heading over.
Little lady, what can Flash do for you? Here you go, Bart.
"Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26.
How about it? Flash.
" Wow, Flash Bailor came on to my wife! You've still got the magic, Marge.
Hey, Dad, look! You're on Jumbo-Vision! Hey, everybody! How you doing? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Homer.
Homer! X-Y-Z.
Examine my zipper? Why? -Thanks, everybody.
-Throwing out tonight's first ball the man whose name is synonymous with the safest energy source: Mr.
Montgomery Burns! -They love you.
-As they should.
When I was a young buck my fade-away pitch was compared to the trouble ball of Satchel Paige.
-Spit on this for me, Smithers.
-One hawker coming up, sir.
What a lame-o! -I could hear the air being torn, sir.
-Oh, shut up! Hey, Burns! Hey, rag arm! -You throw like my sister! -Yeah, you throw like me! To honor America, please rise for our national anthem sung by Springfield's R & B sensation, "Bleeding Gums" Murphy.
Dan Horde, mikeside.
Our Isotopes take on the Shelbyville Shelbyvillians.
We look to snap the longest losing streak in pro baseball.
How about that? We're in the record book! Sitting with the employees proves I'm their friend.
Get me an aisle seat.
I don't want to be surrounded.
Let's go! Swing, batter! -We want a pitcher, not an itcher! -We want a catcher, not a scratcher! -Here we are, sir.
-Oh, no! Sitting next to the boss.
The best night of the year and it's ruined.
Of all the lousy, rotten.
It just means you can't wave your fanny in public.
Rub it in.
-Beer here! Duff Beer! -Beer.
Did you hear that, Marge? Delicious, frosty beer.
Fat lot of good it does me sitting next to Burns.
Now, Homer.
-I suppose you want a beer? -Me, sir? Not a chance.
Only idiots drink beer.
I wonder if you'd join me.
My treat.
If someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm wrong on the subject.
-Are we having a drug test tomorrow? -No.
Vendor, two, please.
The hitter's off his rocker, kissing Betty Crocker! Good one, sir! I used to rile Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park.
Little baby batter, can't control his bladder! Crude, but I like it.
What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie-poos? Don't mind if I do.
-Well, Simpsie, up for another wave? -All right, Burnsie.
Bases loaded, 'Topes have 1 out, down by 3.
Swung on and missed.
Strike 3, of course.
These banjos couldn't carry Pie Traynor's glove.
After Bill McCIoskey pops out, our post-game show starts.
Come on! All we need is a grand slam! My one game of the year, ruined by pathetic incompetence! What's wrong with you? Show some spirit! Your team needs you! Come on! As I got up, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol.
It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.
Some nut's dancing! He has the crowd going.
Can he shake up mediocre slugger Bill McCloskey? Swung on and belted to deep left field! Going, going, gone! It's out of here! Oh, my God! The Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game! -That was certainly exciting.
-Yes.
But Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the evening.
He's banned for life from all company outings.
Way to go, Homer.
Thank you.
You're too kind, but I can't take all the credit.
The batter did his part too.
Excuse me.
You, the dancing fella.
I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara.
I own the Isotopes.
-Would you like to be our mascot? -Me? A mascot for a bush-league team? I should've slept on it, or at least stared blankly.
If I hadn't thought of a nickname, all our lives might've been spared.
-Get on the bus, Dancing Homer! -Shut up! I'm thinking of a name! Well, I'm ready to punch in.
-Hey, cool, man! -Our lives have taken an odd turn.
-Did they ask you to dress like that? -No, this was my idea.
Don't fill up on those vegetables.
Save room for nachos.
All right! For the first time, people didn't laugh at me.
They laughed towards me.
'Topes win! Two in a row! A Simpson on a T-shirt! I never thought I'd see the day.
I'll stick this where the sun don't shine.
Oh yeah? And where might that be? I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight.
Give me "Baby Elephant Walk" with a little reggae beat.
-Go, Dancing Homer! Get up, man! -Lively up yourself, Dancing Homer.
Bases loaded, two outs.
The good guys trail by a run.
S-P-R- -l-N-G- -F-E-E-L-D! Springfield! Here's the pitch.
Swung on and missed.
Strike three.
'Topes lose.
'Topes lose.
'Topes lose.
You wanted to see me? Now we both knew when you began doing this, you wouldn't be here forever.
You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot! -You make me sick.
-I'm not firing you.
You've been called up to Capital City.
-Me? The majors? -That's right.
Wait, Capital City has a mascot.
The greatest one there is: The Capital City Goofball.
He's getting old, needs someone to fill in a few innings a night.
-Could be a big opportunity.
-I'll say! -Why don't you talk to your family? -Because they might say no.
This was a big decision.
I should've listened to my kids, not my dumb wife.
I shouldn't call her that.
Bite my tongue.
I can't go! I was born here.
I thought I'd die here.
It's not so bad.
You'll die someplace else.
-What do I do about friends? -You'll make new, better friends.
But, Dad, we're simple people with simple values.
Capital City is too complex.
Everyone here knows us and has forgiven us.
I'd be lying if I didn't say this scares me a little.
But we all have a calling, a reason God put us on this earth.
Yours is dancing on dugouts.
-You mean--? -Let's do it! Let's never look back! Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
I've gotta convince my supervisor to give me time off.
Sure.
What would you like? Four, five years? So you're really moving to Capital City? -That's right.
-And all this is for sale? I don't know how to say this, but.
Knock it off.
Don't start blubbering on me.
I'm gonna miss you too.
Not.
I don't know.
I'll miss you and all, but-- Milhouse, this way, we'll be friends forever.
Well, okay.
-I'll miss you, spit brother.
-I'll miss you, spit brother.
If we had known each other better, my leaving would actually mean something.
We have one quick stop, and then it's on to Capital City.
I can't believe it.
Our baby sister.
-I'll call every day.
-Me too.
Look.
He can use a horn.
Oh, shut up! Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life.
Little education, bald as a cue ball 10 years on the same job for the same salary.
But today, as I leave for Capital City I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth.
With the fickle fans already forgetting me I was ready to take the biggest step of my life.
Well, kids.
There it is! Capital City! Look! The Crosstown Bridge.
-Wow! -Wow.
The Pennyloafer! Kids, look! Street crime.
Wow, that's service.
-Look, it's Tony Bennett! -Hey, good to see you.
Fourth Street and D! The Duff Brewery! Capital City, yeah! C-A-P-I.
-Come to bed, Homie.
-Sorry, honey.
I'm just a little nervous.
We would talk about it always: For the first time ever Marge fell asleep before I did.
Okay, here are your tickets.
You're with the players' wives.
Cheer for me.
See you afterwards when you're a star.
Bart was strangely quiet.
Later, he said he was confused by his respect for me.
It wouldn't last.
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
It's you! -The Capital City Goofball.
-Hello, glad to have you.
If you need anything, just squeeze the wheeze.
The 5th inning will be yours.
Everyone is settled in, had a couple of beers.
-It's an important inning.
-The 5th.
It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper in the front.
-Right, Mr.
Goofball.
-Call me Goof.
What's your plan? I dance and spell out the name of the city to "Baby Elephant Walk.
" Mancini: the mascot's best friend.
See you on that field.
I set them up, you knock them down.
Dave Glass talking at you.
We got great weather tonight under the dome.
Let's see.
Upper, upper, upper mezzanine.
-Yes, these must be ours.
-These seats stink! -I thought the wives would be closer.
-This section is for the ex-wives.
-He had some bimbo in Kansas City.
-Throw at his head! A free ticket to a big-league park, but I was too tense to enjoy the game.
I was too focused on the task at hand.
-Red Hots! Get your Red Hots! -Ooh, Red Hots.
Ladies and gentlemen, Capital City's newest sensation: Dancin' Homer! These do taste better at the ballpark.
There he is! I was graceful.
I was witty.
Brother, I was something! But they didn't care.
What is with these people? -What's he doing wrong? -I don't know.
It was so quiet, I could hear each smart-ass remark.
-He doesn't make me want to cheer.
-I pity him, making a fool of himself.
These cornball antics don't play in Capital City! The only applause I got was for leaving.
Mr.
Showmanship, the owner wants to see you in his office.
I'm sorry, you're not ready.
Pick up your check.
And put some clothes on! Well, back to Springfield.
I can't! Not after I've seen Capital City! I'll wither and die like a flower.
Stop it.
Don't look too down.
It's hard enough for your dad.
-All right, Homer! Way to go! -What a family.
My wife and kids stood by me.
On the way home, I realized how little that helped.
So that's it.
The costume's buried now.
As my son would say, I'm one sad, ape-like dude.
-Wow.
-What a saga.
You guys are hanging on my every word.
I'm the center of attention.
-It's riveting.
-Tell it again, Homer.
I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
I don't know.
They just do.

ust my hump all week.
Stupid grass! Supposed to be the boy's job.
Now, Homer, Bart's working on his science project.
You heard the lady, Homer.
So please mow quietly.
Genius at work.
One o'clock.
Still just a potato.
Hey, neighbor.
The Lord's given us a beautiful day, huh? Hi, Flanders.
-Doing yard work? -Who told? Marge, beer me.
Say, Simpson, I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in half a jiff.
Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where? There, there, and there's a big patch over there.
There's nothing wrong with crabgrass.
It just has a bad name.
Everyone would love it if it was called "elfgrass.
" -You may be right.
-Where's my Duff? We're all out.
Would you like fruit juice? -Don't toy with me, woman.
-Couldn't help overhearing.
I've got suds in the rumpus room, if you'll join me.
Okay, what the heck.
I've earned a little break.
Holy moly, it's beautiful! This is your first visit to our homestead, eh? We've only been neighbors for one, two, three, four-- Eight years.
There's my little popcorn ball.
Kissy, kissy.
Hello, sponge cake.
In case you're hungry, I made club sandwiches.
-Ain't she wonderful? -Forgetting something? Your beer.
Is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week.
-This is a tasty lager from Holland.
-Beggars can't be choosey.
Dad, thanks for helping me with my science project.
Sure, study buddy.
-I've got the best dad in the world.
-Now you know how that embarrasses me.
I know.
Toodley doodley.
-Kids can be a trial sometimes.
-Knock it off! Knock what off? You've rubbed it in the whole time.
Your family is better than my family.
Your beer is from farther away.
You and your son like each other.
Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt.
You make me sick.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I hope you understand.
I wouldn't stay on a bet! One for the road.
Homie, quit tossing.
Sorry, Marge.
I'm just steamed up about that jerk Flanders.
-Lousy bragging know-it-all showoff.
-What did he say? Get this.
He said that-- He said.
Well, it was how he said it.
-How did he say it? -He.
-Was he angry? -No.
-Rude? -It wasn't how he said it either but the message was loud and clear.
Our family stinks.
I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say he's always been a perfect neighbor.
-He's perfect now, is he? -He's not perfect, but he is nice.
Don't backpedal.
You were right.
He's perfect.
Perfect in every way.
I'm just gonna walk around the block to calm down.
I'm not perfect, like Ned Flanders.
Neddie, you're tossing.
What's the matter? I feel awful.
I forget that we have it better than the Simpsons.
I drag him over, he has a beer.
Can't blame him for erupting.
Then I turn into a snarling beast.
I flunked the turn-the-other-cheek test.
-Maybe I'm not who you should talk to.
-You're right.
-Hello, Reverend Lovejoy? -This is Mrs.
Lovejoy.
Just a minute.
Honey, honey, wake up.
-Ned Flanders is having a crisis.
-Probably stepped on a worm.
Hello, Ned.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I threw a man out of my house today.
I feel like I've violated Matthew 19: 19.
-Huh? -"Love thy neighbor.
" Oh, Matthew 19: 19, yeah, right.
Ned, the Good Book says a gentle answer turneth away wrath.
That is a jim-dandy idea! Bless you, Reverend.
"Dear Neighbor.
" Flanders! I don't blame you for being upset.
I just wanted to give you this.
I'll leave now.
"Dear Neighbor.
" "You are my brother.
I love you.
And yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom.
" "Bosom.
" Wait, wait, there's more.
That's awful.
He opens his heart, and you laugh at him.
"Neighbors forever.
" Oh, no.
"Ned Flanders.
" -What a sap.
-Read the bosom part again, Dad.
-Now, just a minute.
-Bosom.
Bart! I wish we were as close as the Flanders.
Okay, she's right.
Let's do something together.
How about some miniature golf, followed by frosty milkshakes? -All right! -I was going to wash my hair.
I'm studying for the math fair.
If I win, I'll get a protractor.
Too bad we don't live on a farm.
Let's go.
Fore! But I got it in the middle.
-D'oh! That was practice.
-Play it where it lays.
There's Homer Simpson.
What a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter.
-Give up, there's a six-stroke limit.
-I can still make this for five.
Come on, baby, please, please go in.
Please! -Hi, Simpson, having fun? -What are you doing here? Mini-golfing with Todd-meister.
-Hi, Bart! -Get bent.
Since we're friends, how about a foursome? -Okay.
-Great.
Fun.
You looked like you had some trouble.
Jack Nicholson couldn't make that shot.
It is difficult.
The best strategy is to play conservatively.
Hug the rail.
It won't go in, but you set up an easy deuce.
-It went in.
-Good shot.
Luck.
Final score: Bart, 41.
Homer.
Six plus six, plus six, plus six, plus six-- -Never mind.
-Look! -"First prize, $50.
" -"Balloons for everyone who enters.
" Bartley, thinking of entering? He's entering, and he's gonna win.
Aren't you, boy? It's possible.
I like that confidence but don't pressure him.
Todd's very good.
Yeah? The fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day.
Come on, boy.
Dad, I've never won anything in my life.
This is the only time I will ever say this.
It is not okay to lose.
Stay, stay.
Good dog.
Keep your head down.
Not you, I'm talking to the boy.
Keep your head down.
Follow through.
That didn't work, so move your head and don't follow through.
Hey! That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player what a violin is to the guy-- The violin guy.
-Now give your putter a name.
-What? -Give it a name.
-Mr.
Putter.
Wanna try a little harder? -Give it a girl's name.
-Mom.
It's Charlene.
-Why? -It just is, that's why.
This is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders.
Every day spend 15 minutes staring at it concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene destroy him.
-Who? -I'll show you who she is.
Now start hating.
Hi, Bart.
-I overheard you warping Bart's mind.
-And? Aren't you making too big a deal of this tournament? But this is our chance to show up the Flanderses.
Sure, but why do we want that? Sometimes the only way to feel good is to make someone feel bad and I'm tired of making people feel good.
Hi.
What are you doing? Who are those guys in chess that don't matter? A blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you mean a pawn.
Right.
I am a pawn.
It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has almost no interest in everything I do.
Bart, I think I can help you.
We begin at the library.
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi, Mrs.
Norton.
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, Ralph.
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, gang.
Bart, this is the card catalog.
Let's see.
"Golf.
" "Anecdotes, "Eisenhower and, " "Humor, "Japanese Obsession With".
Here it is: Putting.
And the most important book of all, the Tao Te Ching by Lao-tzu.
-We can't afford all this.
-We're just borrowing them.
Oh.
Gotcha.
-Close the logical part of your mind.
-Okay.
-Embrace nothingness.
-Sure.
-Become like uncarved stone.
-Done.
-You're pretending to understand me.
-True.
-It's very frustrating.
-I'll bet.
I have a riddle for you.
What's the sound of one hand clapping? Piece of cake.
It's a 3000-year-old riddle with no answer.
It's supposed to clear your mind.
No answer? Lisa, listen up.
Try another one.
If a tree falls and no one's around, does it make a sound? Absolutely.
But, Bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it? It is time.
The basis of this game is simple geometry.
Just hit the ball here.
You've actually found a practical use for geometry! What is this? -Get down before the neighbors see-- -Simpson! I don't care how this looks.
He's gonna mop up with your son's butt.
May the best man win.
"May the best man win.
" The loser's mating call.
Just a minute.
My son has a very good chance.
-Yeah? Wanna bet? -I'm not a betting man.
-I'm a chicken, am I? -Right.
How's this? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes.
-Are you afraid to make a real bet? -No, I just-- -Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
-How about this, Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.
And if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job for once.
Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress! You have yourself a bet, you jackaninny! -Read that back to me.
-"The father of the loser--" "Loser" is such a harsh word.
How about "the boy who doesn't win"? Oh, man.
Fine.
"The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
" You both have to sign? I hope blood isn't necessary.
I'm game if you are, Flanders.
Good gravy, what did I do? Straighten your arm.
Rotate your shoulders.
Dad! Son, all I'm asking is that you try.
I'll try.
Anybody can try.
I want you to win! Homer? Marge, give me your honest opinion.
This, or this? Morning! By the way, the tournament is today.
And you'd better win.
-Dad! -See you downstairs, boy.
-That crazy Marmaduke.
-Eight hole? -Octopus, third tentacle.
-Twelfth? -Off the grave.
-Nirvana? Bliss from oblivion of self.
Here you go.
A lumberjack's meal for my golfer.
Mom, Bart is on a diet of complex carbohydrates.
-Steak will make him logy.
-What won't make him logy? -Oatmeal.
-Oatmeal? A racehorse eats oats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
News flash, Lisa.
Bart is not a horse.
Eat your steak, boy.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to the finale of a stirring afternoon of miniature golf.
The cream has risen, the wheat has bid farewell and we begin the final match with two warriors: The unknown Bart Simpson and Todd Flanders one of the most skilled Having never received encouragement, I'm not sure how it should sound.
-But here goes.
I believe in you.
-Thanks, man.
-Lord, we beseech thee-- -It's no use praying.
I already prayed, and we can't both win.
Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
Flanders, it doesn't matter.
Tomorrow you'll be in high heels.
-No, you will.
-Afraid not.
Afraid so, infinity plus one.
Young Flanders has the honor and will tee off first.
It's got a chance.
Yes, sir.
Tree falling in the woods.
Tree falling in the woods.
Tree falling.
And the battle is well and truly joined.
Mercy's for the weak, Todd.
If one looked up "courage", one might find a photo of these two gladiators.
Near the Great Emancipator at the last hole, each has eight strokes.
The victor shall drink champagne while his opponent tastes bitter defeat.
It's okay, son.
You can recover.
Remember what Vince Lombardi said! "Lose, and you're out of the family.
" Neither in best form.
This pressure can unhinge the steeliest competitor.
-This is intense, isn't it? -My knees are shaking I got butterflies in my stomach.
But it builds character.
-Who wants character? Let's quit.
-Okay.
-We decided we're equally good.
-We want to call a draw, man.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw.
Forgive this Brit for crying, but this is the most stirring display of gallantry since Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.
-Put it there, man.
-All right! Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners and neither of us has to do that wager.
-Put it there.
-You're welching on our bet? What? Neither boy lost.
"The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
" But neither-- We-- You have to do it too.
Small price to see you humiliated.
My best dress.
One day I'll be telling this to a psychiatrist.
Listen to them laughing.
This is so humiliating.
I'm never gonna live this down.
Damn Flanders.
Simpson, I feel silly, but what the hay? Reminds me of my old fraternity days.
Oh, my God.
He's enjoying it! Shh!

Stop fighting with your sister! -She took my glue! -It's not yours! This is family glue! Stop it! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away! This isn't about glue.
He only wants the glue because I'm using it.
-Oh, yeah? Prove it! -Here.
Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue.
Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J.
Moose.
Bullwinkle's antler's sprung a leak.
Bullwinkle got a taste of his own medicine.
-He certainly did, Bill.
-Wait, what did--? -Did that make sense? -Not really, Bill.
-Now I know how the Pilgrims felt.
-What? -Who the hell is that? -Bullwinkle.
-Who's that? -Underdog.
Don't you know anything? They should use cartoons made in the last 50 years.
This is a tradition.
If you build a balloon for every cartoon character you'll turn the parade into a farce.
Maggie! I'm about to unveil my centerpiece.
It's a tribute to the women who made our country great.
See, there's Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan B.
Anthony and this is Marjory Stoneman Douglas.
She worked her whole life to preserve the Florida Everglades.
Would you like to contribute something to it? Oh, thank you.
-Honey, you're in the way.
-Can't I help? Well, okay.
Can you do the cranberry sauce? Yeah! Where is it? -The can is in the cupboard.
-Here? -No, the other shelf.
-Got it.
Now what? -Open the can.
-Where's the can opener? It's in the second drawer from the right.
No, no, the other one.
Oh, I got you.
It's broken, Mom.
Mom, it's broken.
Mom, it's broken Mom, it's broken I don't think that it's broken.
Here, let me try.
Here you go.
Cranberry sauce Ã  la Bart.
Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done, Bart.
Bart? Those silver-and-blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys.
They're Daddy's favorite team.
He wants them to lose by less than five points.
Kogen's got Wolodarsky open way down field.
Oh, what a hit! -Yeah, he's out cold, Gil.
-Yes.
They'll feed him dinner through a tube.
Hope they can fit a turkey in there.
-Homer, you should pick up Grandpa.
-Halftime, Marge.
Here comes the cavalry.
-You promised to be nice to my sisters.
-I know, I will.
-You brought food? -Just a few things.
Swedish meatballs.
-And my trout almondine.
-You knew I was cooking a turkey.
-Which is fine.
-More power to you.
Some people find your turkey a little dry.
Now they'll have an option.
Hi, Patty.
Hi, Selma.
It's good to see you.
Gotta pick up my old man! Bye! -So insincere.
-How does she put up with him? And now, get set for our fabulous halftime show featuring the young go-getters of Hurray for Everything! I love those kids! They got such a great attitude! Ladies and gentlemen, Hurray for Everything invites you to join them in a salute to the greatest hemisphere the Western hemisphere! The dancing-est hemisphere! Before we sit down to our delicious turkey purÃ©e I have happy news.
These people have relatives who wish they could be here: Antonowski, Conroy, Falcone, Martin, Thorsen, and Walsh.
Oh, and Mrs.
Spencer, you too.
Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me.
-Dad, let's get out of here.
-What's your hurry? -This place is depressing.
-Hey, I live here! Well, I'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it.
Mom, you made it! How are you?! I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll just say one thing: You never do anything right.
-Thank you! -You're super! In the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs as Hurray for Everything leaves! A stadium's too big for flash pictures to work, but nobody cares! That's no way to lay a fire! -This will roar any time now.
-A caveman could start it.
-Dinner! Dinnertime, everybody! -The hell with this.
Okay, Lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece.
Lisa, my goodness.
That's very impressive.
Holy moly! That's the biggest one of those I ever saw! -I always said she was gifted.
-Definitely from our side.
Right, Mom? -Leave me be.
-How long did that take you? I couldn't tell you.
It was a labor of love.
It's my homage to some heroes who may not have fought any wars, but who-- Speaking of heroes, here's mine: Tom Turkey! -Yikes! What is that? -It's the centerpiece.
-It's taking up real estate.
-Stop it! -Move it, toots! -Mom! I'm sure there's room for both.
Let me.
Bart, you're wrecking it! Let go! I worked forever on this! -Hey, that got her going! -Bitchen! Bart! You don't even care! You don't even care! All right, that's it! Go to your room now! I'll take some white meat to go, and send up the pie.
-I said now! -Mom, do I have to? Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! You've ruined Thanksgiving! I didn't ruin Thanksgiving, she did.
I always get blamed.
And Lord, we're thankful for nuclear power the cleanest, safest energy source except for solar, which is a pipe dream.
Thank you for the occasional moments of love our family's experienced.
Not today.
You saw what happened! Lord, be honest! Are we the most pathetic family in the universe? -Amen.
-Worst prayer yet.
Why don't I go talk to the children? Don't worry, Marge will fix everything.
Honey, your food is getting cold.
-That's all right.
-I'm sorry about what happened.
I poured my heart into that centerpiece! -Things like that always happen! -I've noticed that.
When you feel like coming down, we'll be there.
You can come down to dinner when you're ready to apologize.
And it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody.
Apologize? For what? Clearing the table? Having a sense of humor? They think they can starve an apology out of me? Uh-oh.
I mean, good! Hey, what are you doing?! No! Drop that drumstick! Bad dog! Bad Santa's Helper.
Come on, give me that.
Give me that! Don't! Okay, out you go! Boy, come here.
You're a good dog.
We don't need them to get a Thanksgiving dinner.
Wow! Swanky! Smithers, every year you outstrip yourself in succulence.
Thank you, sir.
Would you like some yams? No, I couldn't eat another bite.
Dispose of all this.
I did save room for your special pumpkin pie.
It's cooling on the windowsill.
Stay here, boy.
Mr.
Burns? Base command.
The intruder is a young male, age 9 to 11.
Release the hounds.
I saw the best meals Of my generation destroyed By the madness of my brother My soul carved in slices By spiky-haired demons Don't worry.
We'll get some grub.
Even if we have to pay for it.
Cool! The wrong side of the tracks.
Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed.
You've gotta be 18.
Let's see some I.
D.
-Here you go, doll face.
-Okay, Homer.
Just relax.
At the risk of losing my voice let me just say one more thing: I'm sorry I came.
-When's he going to apologize? -He's stubborn.
Homer was never stubborn.
He always folded instantly.
As if he had no will of his own.
-Isn't that true, Homer? -Yes, Dad.
Twelve bucks and a free cookie.
What a country.
-Cute little guy.
-He's coming around.
-You look a little pale, son.
-We better get you some food.
Here we are.
All right! Twelve big ones and free grub! Viva skid row! Hey, it's that anchor dude from Channel 6.
He's doing one of those be-thankful stories.
We have lots of names for these people: Bums, deadbeats, losers, scums of the earth.
We'd like to sweep them into the gutter or to some other out-of-the-way place.
Oh, we have our reasons: They're depressing.
-They're crazy.
They smell bad.
-Hey, listen, man.
I'm going somewhere.
So every year on one lone, conscience-salving day we toss these people a bone.
A turkey bone.
That's supposed to make it all better.
You won't find the freeloader or Charlie Chaplin's little tramp here.
Pompous, blow-dried, college boy! -His girlfriend does the weather.
-You don't say.
Lisa wants to read us a poem she's written.
Sounds interesting.
"Howl of the Unappreciated" by Lisa Simpson.
"I saw the best meals--" -It's Bart! -What show is this? How long have you been on the streets? -Five years.
-Your family may be watching.
-Anything you'd like to say? -Ha-ha! I didn't apologize! Oh, no! My sweet, little Bart.
Give me the number for 911! Thanks for your help.
This reporter smells another Emmy.
We're rooting for you.
Got someplace to sleep tonight, Bart? Yeah, there's this family I hang out with.
-Sounds pretty sweet.
-Yeah, I guess it is.
See you at Christmas.
Guys, unless you feel weird about taking money from a kid, I thought.
-I wouldn't feel weird.
-I'm comfortable with it.
Forget the report? He's down at the Rescue Mission! He's long gone.
Can you think of a reason why he ran away? Well, we did kind of yell at him and sent him to his room and forced him to apologize to his sister.
-I said he ruined Thanksgiving.
-Oh, I see.
Best Thanksgiving ever, eh, boy? Goodbye.
I'm sure Bart will be back.
I'd say something comforting, but you know, my voice.
Let's go! If I'm not back at the home by 9 they declare me dead and collect my insurance.
This is a terrible thing that's happened.
-But we can't blame ourselves.
-We can! Children need discipline.
Ask any advice columnist.
Marge, are we ever gonna see him again? Should I or shouldn't I? -Hey, everybody, I'm home.
-Bart? You're home! Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried! Boy, we were afraid we'd lost you! Welcome back, Bart.
I'm sorry we had such a terrible fight.
Isn't there something you'd like to say to her? -Okay, I'm sorry too.
-No, no, no! That won't do at all! Get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness.
Yeah, beg me, Bart.
Beg me! Lisa, I beg of you, please forgive me.
Now we can blame him for everything! -It's your fault I'm bald! -Sorry.
-It's your fault I'm old! -Sorry.
-It's your fault I can't talk! -Sorry.
It's your fault America has lost its way.
-It's all your fault.
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry all right.
Sorry I came back here! Whoa! My whiffle balls, my water rockets! Jackpot! A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl Simpson down by six with two seconds left.
He's got Simpson in the open.
Touchdown, Simpson! The boy nobody wanted just won the Super Bowl! Dear Log, my brother is still missing and maybe it's my fault.
I failed to take his abuse with humor.
I miss him so much already that I don't know.
Hey, Lisa! It's me, Bart! -Bart? Where are you? -I'm on the roof.
What are you doing? Everybody's worried.
-Did they cry? -Yes.
Bull's-eye! -Why did you burn my centerpiece? -Come on.
Because you hate me or because you're bad? I don't know.
I don't know why I enjoyed it or why I'll do it again! -Just tell me you're sorry.
-Why? The only reason to apologize is if you look inside yourself and find a spot you wish wasn't there because you feel bad you hurt my feelings.
-Leave me alone.
-Just look! Okay, okay.
Looking for the spot.
Still checking.
This is stupid.
I won't find anything.
Just because I wrecked something she worked hard at and made her-- -I'm sorry, Lisa.
-Apology accepted.
You know, Marge, we're great parents.
O Lord, we thank thee for giving us one more crack at togetherness.
Amen.

Live from Springfield, the wrestling match of the century! -Rasputin, the Friendly Russian.
-Wasn't he the Mad Russian? History has changed wrestling, perhaps forever.
The challenger from Heidelberg, Professor Burnabon Brawn.
With a "W.
" Two titans in their prime.
This is going to be one hell of a match! I hope you're not taking this seriously.
as choreographed as ballet.
Rasputin's got the reach, but the Professor's got his coma lock.
This is gonna be one hell of a match.
Look at that showoff, kissing his own muscles.
He's spinning the Professor! That's disorienting! Hey, Milhouse, crank it up.
-That's my seat.
-Correction, was your seat.
But I only got up to go to the can.
I don't see your name on this barstool.
One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! The ref is issuing a warning to Rasputin.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
Why is this referee permitting this? This Saturday, your life will be changed forever.
Saturday, at the Springfield Speedway.
"Crusher" Woodard, "The Skunk" Trumane and the Dunk Masters in the Monster Truck Rally! Plus the amazing, unbelievable, Truck-a-saurus! Twenty tons and four stories of car-crunching, fire-breathing insanity! One night only, at the Springfield Speedway! If you miss it, you better be dead or in jail.
If you're in jail, break out! Be there! Truck-a-saurus! I have an announcement.
As a family growth thing we should go to the Monster Truck Rally this Saturday.
Aren't you forgetting something? Monster Truck Rally, growth thing, I don't think so.
Lisa's recital is Saturday.
I have my first solo.
If you miss it, start looking for a child therapist.
-But Truck-a-saurus is one night only! -Cruel fate, why do you mock me? Come on.
What time does your truck game start? -8:00, but what does it matter? -Lisa's recital starts at 5:00.
-We can go to both.
-Marge, you're a genius! Let's have good assembly manners.
People! People! Quiet, please! Don't make me flick the lights on and off.
Thank you.
Ladies, gentlemen, parents.
Welcome to the first in a series of concerts.
Series! Tonight, Sherbert's-- Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.
Good, unfinished.
This shouldn't take long.
Remember, children, stay together.
Five, six, seven, eight! -That was beautiful.
Can we go now? -Sit down, Homer.
How much longer was Sherbert planning on making this? Lisa was great.
Her fingering's come a long way.
-Thanks, Flanders.
Big know-it-all.
-When's Todd's solo, Dad? It's coming up, son.
It's coming up.
-My son, my son.
-Come on, Flanders.
He's not that bad.
-I reached him.
-Drive defensively.
-The best defense is a good offense.
-Faster, Dad.
Truck-a-saurus awaits! Damn, no spots! I think there's one over there.
-Dad? -Not now, Lisa.
Come on.
-Homer.
-What? -Truck-a-saurus! -Where? Where? Pull! Pull, you dogs! Let's see, cracked windshield, melted bumpers punctured radiator, teeth marks in the trunk.
At least there's no frame damage.
-This check should handle it.
-Thank you.
I'm Leo G.
Clark, inventor and operator of Truck-a-saurus.
Truck-a-saurus feels very badly about what happened.
We'd like you to have a half-bottle of champagne for being such good sports.
Thank you.
Everyone's so nice here, at the Monster Truck Rally.
Look, Homer, champagne! Now, Majestic Undercoating is proud to present: Ms.
Monster! Wow, a woman mud pool driver.
Another barrier broken.
Right on, sister! Let the destruction begin! Hey, they forgot my corn dogs.
-Give me some nachos, Homer-saurus.
-Here, Bart-a-saurus.
Now, we have a surprise guest.
The world's greatest daredevil.
He's no stranger to danger.
If he's not in action, he's in traction.
Captain Lance Murdock! Ladies and gentlemen, and especially little children.
I'm glad you're here to witness what may be my grisly death.
Tonight, my most dangerous stunt.
I will death defy nature and gravity by leaping over this water tank filled with great white sharks deadly electric eels, ravenous piranhas, alligators and most frightening, the king of the jungle one ferocious lion! I almost forgot.
To add a real element of danger one drop of human blood.
On the chance I don't live, let me say seat belts save lives, so buckle up! This is so cool.
Oh, I can't watch! He made it! Bitchen! He's okay, folks! What a fun-filled evening.
Ladies and gentlemen, a 10-year-old who's brave and bold! When he's not in class, he risks his ass! The greatest daredevil, Bart Simpson! Bart! Bart! Bart? Bart? We're home, son.
-Dad, I wanna be a daredevil.
-Kids say such stupid things.
-You're crazy.
-You'll never make it.
Spare me your lectures, ladies.
-Oh, no! He's hurt! -Bad! Let's get out of here! -My little boy! -Come on, Marge, we're mad at him.
-Are you all right? -Better than all right.
I got stitches! Probably a scar too.
Bart says he got hurt training for a career in death defiance? Yes, we saw a daredevil last night and monkey see, monkey do.
I know something that may discourage this behavior.
These children have been hurt doing stunts they saw on television, movies and the legitimate stage.
This little boy broke his leg trying to fly like Superman.
His brother hit him with a wrench, mimicking a TV wrestling match.
I won't show the horrors of our Three Stooges ward.
I didn't know TV was a dangerous influence.
It's tragic, but it's a small price to pay for top-notch entertainment.
Amen! Has Dr.
Hibbert made his point? He certainly has.
I learned a real lesson.
Thanks, Dr.
Hibbert.
-I did it.
-Wow! All right! Way happening! -Awesome! -You're the king! Thank you! How about a hand for these brave animals? Hi, kids.
Thanks.
Okay, field-trippers.
Off the bus.
-What's the matter? -I'm running on empty, Milhouse.
You kids like my jumps, and I love you for it but it's too easy.
There must be a challenge worthy of me.
Hi, children.
Welcome to Springfield Gorge.
Wow! Gnarly! I bet you could toss a body in there and no one would ever find it.
Otto, I'm gonna jump Springfield Gorge on my skateboard.
As the only adult here, I feel I should say something.
-What? -Cool! Hey, Otto! Can I use that microphone? Sorry, Bart-dude.
It's for emergencies only.
-I wanna tell them about my jump.
-Okay.
Attention, please.
This Saturday I'll be jumping Springfield Gorge.
There's a good chance I'll fall to my death.
Hope to see you there! Springfield Gorge! You'll be killed! I can't explain it, but I get the same thrill from jumping stuff that you do from reading.
Before you do anything, there's someone you should talk to.
Thanks for arranging this.
Anything that decreases entertainment-related injuries.
You're meeting the world's best daredevil, Lance Murdock.
This is Lisa and Bart Simpson.
Bart's one of your biggest fans.
It's an honor, Lance.
How you feeling? Doc, I heard a snap.
I'm afraid it's broken.
That's all of them.
I've broken that dozens of times.
I bet you'd like an autograph.
Nurse? -Who should I make it to? -Just Bart.
To Bart: Thanks for visiting me at Springfield General Hospital.
Your visit was a ray of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day.
Your pal, Captain Lance Murdock.
-Wow, man! Thanks, Lance.
-You're welcome.
Take this thing.
My brother's gonna jump Springfield Gorge on a skateboard.
Could you leave me with the kids, please? Let me start by saying, good for you, son.
Good to see kids interested in danger.
People will say you're nuts.
Maybe they're right.
But the fact is: bones heal, chicks dig scars and the U.
S.
A.
has the best doctor to daredevil ratio in the world.
-But Captain Murdock-- -Thanks! You're welcome.
Tell the nurse it's my bath time.
Another fringe benefit.
Nurse! Springfield Gorge! We settled this daredevil junk! -Squealer.
-Sorry, but if you got hurt or died despite the attention I'd get, I'd miss you.
-I forbid you to jump.
-You can't.
I can and do! Go to your room! There, I did it.
I'm glad somebody stepped in and put an end to this nonsense.
You can tell me not to do it, but you can't watch me 24 hours a day.
And the minute your back is turned, I'm heading for that gorge.
He's got us.
There's nothing we can do.
He's as good as dead.
Homer, you're his father.
Reason with him.
That never works.
He's a goner.
Come on, Homer, a heart-to-heart talk with your son.
-You've got to try.
-Okay, okay.
I'll try.
-Bart? What are you doing?! -Nothing.
-You were gonna jump the gorge.
-Maybe.
Look, I know I can't stop you.
I can only ask you -to promise me you won't do it.
-Okay, I promise.
-What? -You didn't mean that! This isn't a promise I don't expect you to keep.
-lf you promise, you have to keep it.
-Why? If you don't, I'll never believe you ever again.
-Come on.
-I mean it, boy! Okay, Dad.
I promise.
I won't jump Springfield Gorge.
That's my boy.
-How did it go? -We got a pretty good kid there.
Well, he's got a pretty good father.
-Where is he? He said noon.
-He's just building suspense.
-What a showman.
-Look, there he is! Hey, boy.
Wanna toss the old--?! Why, that little liar! I should have-- And I was gonna play pickle.
Hey, what gives? I tried ordering you, punishing you, and I even tried reasoning with you.
-Now, I have to jump the gorge myself.
-What? Why? You'll see what it's like to watch a family member risk his life for no good reason! -Dad, you'll never make it.
-Don't you think I know that? -Goodbye, son.
-Wait! Don't do it! -I won't jump anymore.
I promise! -Thank God! Thank God! -I love you, Dad.
-I love you too, son.
I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right-- I'm gonna make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Think you got guts? Try raising my kids!

A dash of rosemary, a smidgen of thyme, a pinch of marjoram.
Marge, you make the best pork chops in the world.
They're nothing special.
The extra ingredient is care.
A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon of turmeric and a whisper of MSG.
-I'm gonna build you a spice rack! -Don't go to all that trouble for me.
It's no trouble! I've got a garage full of tools.
Hey, kids! I spy Itchy and Scratchy off the port bow! -Down in front! -Shut up, boy.
They fight and bite Fight and bite and fight Fight fight fight, bite bite bite The Itchy and Scratchy Show I knew this stuff would be handy.
Let's see now, here it is.
The Complete Handyman's Bookshelf.
"Volume One: Spice Racks.
" "Pick up a hammer.
" Not as easy as I thought it was.
Wow! -Dad, can you move your head? -I can't.
It's broken.
Where would a child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet? No, Maggie! Bad baby! Keep her away! She's got that crazy look again! So television's responsible.
We were watching that.
You won't be watching any more.
Ever! But if you take them away, we'll grow up without humor and be robots.
Really? What kind of robots? I heard about the cartoons.
Tough break.
Thanks, Nelson.
What if you watch it over at my house? Hey, that's just crazy enough to work.
You heard me.
I won't be in for the rest of the week.
I told you.
My baby beat me up.
It is not the worst excuse I ever thought up.
Wise guy.
I wonder why the kids are late getting home.
-How come you can watch cartoons? -Because.
-Because why? -I said so.
-You said so why? -I'm trying to work.
-What are you doing? -Cataloging the violence.
I don't think adults have ever sat down and watched them before.
What kind of warped human being would find that funny? They think this is suitable for younger, impressionable viewers? -Yeah, what are you gonna do? -I'll tell you.
I'll write a letter! Dear Purveyors of Senseless Violence: I know this may sound silly at first but the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior negatively.
Please tone down the violence in your otherwise fine programming.
Yours truly, Marge Simpson.
Take a letter.
"Dear Valued Viewer: Thank you for your interest in our program.
Enclosed is an autographed photo of America's favorite cat and mouse.
As to your comments, research shows one person can't make a difference no matter how screwy she is.
-So, let me close by saying.
" -"And the horse I rode in on"! I'll show them what one screwball can do! Everybody's looking at us, Marge.
That's what we want them to do, Homer.
How long are we gonna do this? I've never changed the world.
I don't know how long it takes.
-lf people take an interest-- -Hello, Marge! -What is "S-N-U-H"? -Snuh.
It's "Springfieldians for Nonviolence, Understanding and Helping.
" It's a crusade against cartoon violence.
I can protect my kids, but many others are being warped each afternoon.
That reminds me.
I've got to get to Milhouse's to play.
-All right.
-I'm going to Janey's.
We'll be making the most of our childhood years.
-Have fun.
-We will.
What happens when a child has insanely violent role models like these? The answer is all around you.
How many of you were hit with mallets last week? I didn't know they made TV dinners this bad.
-Can I watch cartoons? -No.
-There's peas in my cobbler.
-They're everywhere.
-I guess I'll go and watch cartoons.
-No! I'm sorry about the dinners.
-I'll make up for it.
-Who's up for cartoons? -No one! -All right.
Tomorrow, how about making your patented pork chops? Sure! Oh, dear, I can't.
I've got three protest rallies tomorrow.
Twenty million women, and I had to marry Jane Fonda.
Hi, kids! Guess what, Sideshow Mel.
-It's time for Itchy & Scratchy! -Boo! Hey! Settle down, boys and girls.
Or Krusty will bring out his friend Corporal Punishment again.
Please, stop it.
-Who are you people? -What do we want? Less violence in kid's programming! -When do we want it? -Now! They're ruining the show! Stop! Please, stop! Please, lady, be quiet! I'm trying to earn a living here, all right? Stop! That woman.
That screwball, Marge Simpson.
We've got to stop her.
How? -Drop an anvil? -Hit her with a piano? Stuff her with TNT, throw a match and run? All your degrees and that's the best you can do? You make me sick.
Less violence in children's programming! -When do we want it? -Now! Less violence in children's programming! -When do we want it? -Now! I'm so funny! Some of these are good.
I never knew mice lived such lives.
So much brutality.
I don't know if I'm having any impact.
Don't do that! Hey, don't do that! Take that, you dumb squirrel! Where do they get their ideas? What is it? What? Smartline? Yes, I've heard of your late-night panel discussion show.
I'd love to! Smartline! With our local Emmy-winning host, Kent Brockman.
I'm Kent Brockman.
Welcome to another Smartline.
Are cartoons too violent? Most people say, "No! What a stupid question!" One woman says yes.
She's here tonight.
Marge Simpson.
There she is! Also with us for this animated discussion -are Roger Myers-- -Thank you.
--Krusty, whose program brings us Itchy & Scratchy every afternoon.
Hi, Kent! And, joining us via satellite from Vienna, the home of Freud to give insight into the mind, Dr.
Marvin Monroe.
Let's see what this is about.
Here's an example of the work being made at I & S Studios.
Hilarious.
What's wrong with that? -Nothing's wrong with it.
-Excuse me! -He's asking me.
-I know.
Nothing's wrong with it.
-It's a bad influence on children.
-Give me a break! That is baloney.
And here's why: I did some research and discovered a startling thing.
There was violence in the past, before cartoons.
Fascinating.
There was the crusades.
Tremendous violence! Many killed! -It went on for 30 years.
-This was before cartoons? That's right, Kent.
So much for your viewpoint.
Dr.
Monroe, would you care to comment? To me, the high jinks of comic characters pales in comparison with the problems I run into everyday.
I'm referring to women who love too much, fear of winning, sex-aholism.
So you have no objection to Itchy & Scratchy? No, not at all.
One of my guilty little pleasures is to turn on Itchy & Scratchy and laugh myself silly.
What's wrong with that? Not a thing.
Now, for another opinion.
Hi, kids! Please.
This is your chance to participate in a serious discussion.
I'm sorry, Kent.
It's just when the camera gets on me-- -Krusty! -Sorry.
We won't settle this tonight.
Mrs.
Simpson, in the nine seconds left, can you summarize your position? I'd ask the parents concerned about this to write in.
Let the cartoon makers know how you feel.
I don't believe it.
"I won't watch your show, buy your products or brake if I see you crossing the street.
" Wow, that's cold.
"Dear Sleaze Merchant.
" Now, come on, that hurts.
Gentlemen, the screwballs have spoken.
Hello? -Is this Marge Simpson? -Yes.
The Marge who fixed it so cartoons can't be violent? Yes.
This is Myers with the writers.
How do we end this picture? What's the problem? -Itchy stole Scratchy's ice cream-- -Make it a pie.
Easier to draw.
Okay, a pie.
Scratchy is understandably upset.
We figured he'd grab Itchy -and toss him in acid.
-Oh, dear.
But we thought it might be violent, which is wrong now, thanks to you.
What's your idea? -How do we end this? -Let's see.
Couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy? Then they'd both have pie.
It's different, I'll give you that.
A tool every handyman needs.
It's a jigsaw! A drill! It's an asphalt spreader! It's 67 tools in one! -How much would you pay for all this? -$1000! -Don't answer yet.
-Sorry.
-You also get-- -I was watching that! -Time for Krusty.
-We can watch cartoons? -Yes, dear.
All you want.
-All right! -Turn it up! -Hey kids! Time for Itchy & Scratchy! They love, they share They share and love and share Love love love, share share share The Itchy & Scratchy Show! Lemonade? -Please.
-I made it just for you.
You are my best friend.
Itchy and Scratchy have lost their edge.
It's a nice message of sharing.
I think it sucks.
Thank you, Maggie.
-This hits the spot.
-Doesn't it? -You make good lemonade.
-Thank you, Itchy.
Wasn't that funny, boys and girls? Well? Wasn't it? Aren't you going to watch the rest? -No.
Come on.
-Maybe there's something else to do.
But the third bowl of porridge was just right.
Hi, kids! What? Is this Saturday? What did you kids do today? We went fishing.
Almost caught a catfish this big.
I went bird watching and saw a grackle.
That's nice, dear.
-Let's finish our soapbox racers.
-Okay.
-May we please be excused? -Sure.
Wow! What great kids.
This is the golden age, Marge! The parents owe it all to you.
I didn't expect things to change this much.
I always knew you'd make the world better.
This will be the art event of the century! Michelangelo's David on a tour of the U.
S.
Which cities will be in your itinerary? -New York, Springfield-- -Yes? If we have time, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles.
-Marge, get the door.
-What in the world? Get dressed, Marge.
Lead our protest against this abomination.
That's Michelangelo's David.
It's a masterpiece.
Filth.
It portrays parts of the body which, though practical, are evil.
-I like that statue.
-I knew she was soft on nudity.
Come on, girls.
What is this? What do you want? We want your big Italian butt out of here! Smartline.
With our local host, Kent Brockman.
A masterpiece? Or just a guy with his pants down? That's our topic tonight.
-Why are you against the statue? -I'm not.
Everyone should see it.
-Aren't you Marge Simpson, the wacko? -Yes and no.
How can you be for one form of expression, like our naked friend and be against another form, like Itchy & Scratchy? -Good question.
-Well, I guess I can't.
It's a shame.
I hate those cartoons.
What do you say to those out there who wish to suppress David 's doodle? I don't know.
One person can make a difference but probably shouldn't.
Well, I guess that settles that.
We will be ending early tonight.
Tomorrow our topic will be "Religion: Which Is the One True Faith?" -There he is, Michelangelo's Dave.
-David.
-What's wrong, Marge? -Oh, Homie.
The kids have a chance to see great art.
But they're watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other.
Don't worry, Marge.
Soon every kid in school is going to come and see this thing.
-Really? Why? -They're forcing them! Well, isn't that nice?

I think the boy's hurt.
Just give him a nickel and let's get going! I think we should call an ambulance, sir.
Hey, cool.
I'm dead! Please hold on to the handrail.
Do not spit over the side.
Aunt Hortense.
Great-grandpa Simpson.
Snowball! Do not spit over the side.
We told you to hold on to the handrail.
We asked you not to spit over the side.
Howdy, stranger! I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you? Please allow me to introduce myself.
I'm the devil! You've earned eternal damnation for your evil deeds.
-Spitting just clinched it.
-Hey, I'm innocent, man! Innocent! Everybody's innocent.
Okay, let's just pull up your file here.
It's a mistake.
You're due to arrive when the Yankees win the pennant.
Nearly a century from now.
Boy, is my face red! Bart! Is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here? Sure, but you wouldn't like it.
-Okay.
See you later.
-Bye! Remember, lie, cheat, steal and listen to heavy metal music! Yes, sir! Dr.
Warner, wanted in radiology.
-He's awake! -Oh, Bart! We thought you'd gone away from us.
I did go away, Mom! I was miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of hell! And you were there! And you.
And you.
And you.
You I've never seen before.
Yeah, I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance.
Lionel Hutz is the name.
Attorney at law.
My card.
-It turns into a sponge in water.
-Classy.
Would you like to bring legal action against the fiend who did this? The fiend who did this to my boy is my boss.
Besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe.
Doctors are idiots! He might have permanent injuries.
You may have to wait on him for the rest of his life! That's the downside.
Here's the good part.
You can cash in on this tragedy! -Excuse me, are you a shyster? -How does a nice girl know that word? Mr.
Hutz, this is hardly the time to discuss this.
You're right.
When you're up to it, come to my office and we'll talk.
Lionel Hutz, attorney at law.
Is that a broken neck? Great! -Hello, Dr.
Hibbert.
-Hello, Lisa.
-We've got a nasty bump on our head.
-Quit it! -And a tiny broken toe.
-Quit it! Is he well enough for me to start mothering him? Better let him rest a while.
-I heard Mr.
Burns crushed your boy.
-Yeah.
If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr.
Burns' office now and-- Simpson! Burns wants you to march into his office now! Simpson, at last we meet.
Nice to meet you too, sir.
My attorneys advised me to pay for running over your child.
-So I'm cutting you a check.
-Really? Great.
$100.
Of course, you'll have to sign a waiver relinquishing your right to sue.
but his medical bills alone-- So extortion is the name of your game? Then you get nothing! I have the finest lawyers in Springfield.
Tangle with me, and I'll crush you like a paper cup.
Throw him out, Smithers! You don't have to do that.
I can throw myself out.
Lionel Hutz.
In here, Mr.
Simpson.
-Any calls, Della? -Calls? Oh, "calls" ! The Supreme Court called.
They need your help on a freedom thing.
Tell them to sit tight.
I'll get back to them.
This way, Mr.
Simpson.
You sure have got some education.
Yes, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, the Sorbonne, the Louvre.
Oh, well.
Mr.
Simpson, the state bar forbids me from promising you a big cash settlement.
But just between you and me, I promise you a big cash settlement.
My fee is 50 percent.
-50 percent? -You'll be getting more than a lawyer! You'll also get this faux pearl necklace a $99 value, as our gift.
I don't know.
You and I might have different ideas about how big a big cash settlement is.
A million dollars? I stand corrected! A million bucks is A-Okay! Now we'll get a real doctor's opinion.
Bad news! Your son is a very sick boy.
Just look at the X-rays! You see that dark spot there? Whiplash.
Oh, no! And this smudge that looks like my fingerprint? No.
That's trauma! -Am I going to die? -Yes, son! Homer! No, of course you won't.
Everything's fine.
-Will I ever play baseball again? -No! -But I played this morning.
-That's right, he did.
Dr.
Hibbert has been our physician for years.
He thought Bart was fine.
Oh, Dr.
Hibbert, from Johns Hopkins Medical School.
Mrs.
Simpson, you're not a doctor.
He's not, I'm not.
The only person here who comes close is him.
Stop, you're embarrassing me! Are you sure there isn't soft tissue trauma in the face? Oh, yeah.
Tons of it.
Just say when.
A million dollars? Smithers! I want this Homer Simpson fired! Do you think that's wise? Think of the headlines.
What about them? They might be critical of you firing him so soon after the accident.
All right then.
I don't want to seem like an ogre.
I'll bide my time.
Let him twist in the wind.
Slowly, slowly.
When the papers have found their new flavor of the month he'll find out this cat has claws! Good thinking.
Now, let's pretend you're on the witness stand.
-How are you, Bart? -Fine.
Bart says he's fine.
You are not fine! You are in constant pain! I am in constant pain.
-May I make an observation? -What is it? This is a charade to make him look more injured than he is.
Maybe Lisa has a point.
I don't mind it here, but in court, doesn't he have to tell the truth? But what is truth, if you follow me? Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this? You mean like I'm dead? Sure.
The kid's a pro.
Springfield Municipal Court is now in session.
Judge Moulton presiding.
My client's instructed me to remind you how rich he is and that he's not like other men.
I should be able to run over as many kids as I want! I warn you, if you continue to disrupt the court I'll cite you for contempt.
-You wouldn't dare! -Well, no, I guess I wouldn't.
Calling Bartholomew J.
Simpson to the stand.
Oh, please! Hello, Bart.
You know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, don't you? Maybe.
Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart? -No.
-Good.
-Proceed, Mr.
Hutz.
-Thank you.
Tell the jury, in your own words what happened on the day of the accident.
Yes, sir.
It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon.
I played in my childlike way, not realizing I was about to be struck by the luxury car of death! Defenseless child at 3:00! Luckily, I was not killed.
Although sometimes I wish I had been.
He's lying! Now, that's believable testimony.
Mr.
Burns, relate in your own words what really happened on the day of the accident.
Certainly.
It was a beautiful day.
The sun was shining.
I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys.
Suddenly, that incorrigible Simpson boy darted in front of me.
My goodness! Look what's happened! -It's not important.
Let's drive on.
-You cold-blooded monster! Regardless of what you think, we must summon help and comfort him until an ambulance arrives.
No! Take me, I'm old! And that's what happened.
Why are you looking at me like that? You believed his story! It's looking good, Mr.
Simpson.
It's looking very good.
They hate me? What trial were you watching? -Maybe a settlement-- -Settlement! Fine! Hang your heads in shame you overpriced, under-brained notary publics! Just get that ape to my house and we'll buy him off with a banana! And that ugly customer was the last Indonesian rhino on earth.
I didn't know you liked animals.
I don't like everything about them.
Just their heads.
Care for some wine, old buddy? -Don't mind if I do.
-Go, go! Bottoms up.
There's plenty more where that came from.
Are you trying to get me drunk? Yes.
Now, old chum I'm sure you agree this trial is an affront to our collective dignity.
What say we settle this, man to man? You mean duke it out? No, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a generous cash settlement.
A princely sum-- Well, a handsome sum that can end this imbroglio once and for all.
Five hundred thousand dollars.
Goodness! Don't answer me now.
Relax, talk it over.
Soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what can be.
Smithers, let's go powder my nose.
-What do you think? -I don't know.
Maybe we should take it and put this ugliness behind us.
The fish is in the pan.
-What do you think? -I'll tell you.
I think he thinks I'm an idiot! He's offering us this because he knows he'll lose and have to pay us a million.
I feel faint.
$500,000! I spit on his $500,000! What's happened to you? All this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors! Phony doctors? Hello.
Know what I'd settle for? The medical bills and an apology.
You won't even get that.
Offer's expired.
We'll let the jury decide.
Good day.
Smithers, release the hounds.
Your Honor, I'd like to call to the stand Mrs.
Homer J.
Simpson! Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God? Yes, I do.
-She was taking that very seriously.
-Oh, the truth! Mrs.
Simpson, does the name Julius Hibbert mean anything to you? Yes, he's been our family physician and friend ever since I became a mother.
He's seen us through everything with competence and loving care.
But wait a minute! I'm confused.
This court heard expert testimony from one Dr.
Nick Riviera.
What's your opinion of him? My mother said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.
" -Will that hold up? -No, I've tried.
What is your opinion of Dr.
Riviera? And let me remind you, you're under oath! To be honest he seemed more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages than making him feel better.
And he mispronounced words like "abdomen.
" And his office was dirty! Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's a doctor.
And could you describe for us in your own words Bart's "intense mental anguish and suffering"? Well, I don't know how intense it was but he did miss three days of school.
Although he doesn't like school so that may not count as anguish.
It was hard on me, having him around the house.
Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships? We pay Bart $5 a week to take out the trash.
I suppose if he'd been able to do it, we might've given him the $5.
$5? But your lawyer, assuming he is one, is asking for a million! Well, we can't blame them for trying, can we? Thank you, Mrs.
Simpson.
I'm going to write a figure down.
It's not quite as large as the last one but I think you'll find it fair.
We should take it.
A million dollars.
My wife cost me a million dollars.
Would you like more macaroni and cheese? A million dollars' worth, you snake-woman! -No.
-String beans? No, you two-timing, backstabbing-- Better answer.
-No.
-Celery with cream cheese? Just mouth polite nothings.
It would've been cool to get that million.
Bart, please.
We could've bought tons of great stuff.
Maids, a pool, fancy sweaters.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
-Marge, may I go to Moe's for a drink? -Sure.
I may never come back.
Good night.
My woman's intuition is telling me something.
I wonder-- Oh, my God.
Well, I guess this is the class I'll die in.
You're better off.
Rich people aren't happy.
They think they're happy but trust me, they ain't.
Moe, I wish he'd shut up.
-A chick! -And it's not even ladies' night.
Hey, guys.
Knock it off! It's just my wife.
-Well, hello.
-My name's Marge.
Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.
We've squabbled over money before.
Never this much.
It's different than when I washed your pants with the 20 in the pocket-- You think this is about money? It's not.
It's worse.
I'm afraid that when I look at you I won't see the wife by my side or the mother of my children.
I'll see the dame who blew my one big chance.
-What are you saying? -I'm saying-- She's your wife of 10 years, you've had 3 children.
It's time to be honest.
I'm not sure I love you anymore.
Don't worry, I won't let on.
I'll still do the bed stuff.
-Maybe it won't be so bad.
-Oh, my Lord! I don't want to wait to find out if you love me anymore.
I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out.
Homer, look at me! Do it if it'll shut her up.
Start with the feet.
Still angry.
Good, Homer! This is tough, need refreshment.
Trustworthy beer.
My love for you will never die.
All right, look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her-- Who am I kidding? I love you more than ever! -I love you too! -Sorry to scare you like that, babe.
Okay, everybody! For the next 15 minutes, one-third off on every pitcher.
One per customer, domestic beer only.
Hey, no sharing!

-Is it done yet? -It will be ready in 8 seconds.
Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Bing! We have meat loaf! Get it while it's hot, kids.
I've got a dried-out end piece with your name on it.
Thursday.
Meat loaf night.
As it was, is now, and ever shall be.
-Get to the point.
-You want me to be open-minded -try new things, live life-- -Who said that? Nobody wants that.
-Shut up! -Tomorrow night it would be nice -to go out for dinner.
-Friday? Pork chop night? We haven't missed pork chop night since the pig scare in '87! Pork chops.
From cradle to grave, etched in stone-- -Where do you wanna go? -Anywhere but hamburgers or pizza.
Fine! We'll go to Mars! -There's a new sushi place on Elm St.
-Sushi? Maybe this is a playground thing, but isn't that raw fish? The playground has the facts right but missed the point.
-Sushi is considered a delicacy.
-Can we try it? -No.
-This argument humiliates us both.
If I said no the first time, would I say yes the second time? -Maybe on the ninety-ninth time.
-Try me.
-Please, Dad? -No! -Please, Dad? -No! -Please, Dad? -Okay! Don't be alarmed.
They were saying hello.
Okay.
Hello! This is our karaoke bar.
Now it is empty but soon it will be full of drunken Japanese businessmen.
I am Akira.
May I take your order? What do you suggest for a family unsure about being here? Sushi Surprise, a bit of everything.
Very non-threatening.
-I'll have one.
-Make it two.
Akira, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
-Do you have killer giant squid? -Not today.
Sir? It's hard to choose.
It all looks so terrible.
Bring me one of these, one of these and one of those.
-What do you think? -No! The squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman.
Hang your head in shame.
Good thing I'm open-minded.
Not bad.
Interesting! I'll try this little pink one here.
Very good! And another one.
Oh, boy! This fish is delish! Hi, my name is Richie Sakai.
I am an anesthesiologist.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my wife, Patty.
-And two of these things.
-Two uni.
I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roll.
-I recommend the raw quail egg.
-You're the doctor! There's gotta be something I haven't tried.
What's this? Fugu! It's blowfish, sir.
But I should warn you that one-- Come on, pal.
Fugu me! -She's here! Cover for me.
-One fugu.
-Not fugu.
If it's cut improperly-- -Yes, it's poisonous, maybe fatal.
-But cut properly, it's quite tasty.
-I must get the master.
Oh, Miss Krabappel, your hair smells so -clean.
-You're needed in the kitchen.
-I said cover for me, damn it! -Master, we need your skilled hands.
My skilled hands are busy! You do it! Poison.
Poison.
Tasty fish! -Concentrate.
Concentrate.
-I want fugu! Fan-fugu-tastic! Beautiful language, isn't it? -Don't eat another bite.
-I couldn't possibly.
I shall be blunt.
We have reason to believe you've eaten poison.
Poison! What should I do? Tell me quick! Don't panic.
There's a map to the hospital on the menu.
"Try something new.
How can it hurt you, Homer?" Never heard of a poisoned pork chop! Your wife agreed I should tell you.
No need, doc.
I can read Marge like a book.
-It's good news, isn't it? -No, Mr.
Simpson.
If you have consumed blowfish venom, and the chef said it's probable -you have 24 hours to live.
-24 hours? Well, 22.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
-I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die! -I know.
One consolation is that you'll feel no pain until tomorrow evening when your heart explodes.
Death anxiety is normal.
Expect to go through five stages.
-First, denial.
-No way! I'm not dying! -The second is anger.
-Why, you little--! -After that comes fear.
-What's after fear? -Bargaining.
-You gotta get me out of this.
-Finally, acceptance.
-We all gotta go sometime.
Your progress astounds me.
I'll leave you two alone.
Perhaps this pamphlet will be helpful.
"So You're Going to Die.
" Hello, Marge.
Hello! I'm the one dying, not you.
I'm sorry, Homer.
-Have you thought of what to tell them? -Nothing, it'll just upset them.
I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
-You know what you wanna do tomorrow? -Almost.
Oh, good! I'm not done yet, Marge.
What's that word you use for when you and I? When we're intimate? "Be intimate with Marge.
" Can I make one suggestion? Can we get up early and watch the sunrise together? "Watch the sunrise.
" Till 6 a.
m.
, my dearest darling, on my last day on Earth.
-Why did you let me sleep late? -You looked so peaceful.
There will be plenty of time for that! I got tons of stuff to do! "Have man-to-man with Bart.
" -Come here, boy.
-Oh, man.
I wanna have a heart-to-heart talk! After me, you're the man around the house.
So you have to help out-- Lisa never lifts a finger.
Go yell at her! Shut up! This is good stuff.
I wanna share something with you.
The three sentences to get you through life.
Number one: Cover for me.
Number two: Oh, good idea, boss! Three: It was like that when I got here.
-This is good stuff.
-Let's learn how to shave.
Finally, the little spot under your nose.
Next, we take some toilet paper tear off some little squares and stick one there and there, and any place you're bleeding.
There.
The blood will hold it on your face.
And now, some aftershave.
You son of a--! And that's how we shave.
-You little-- -It was like that when I got here! That's my boy! "Listen to Lisa play her sax.
" Want me to cut out this infernal racket? -Let me hear you play.
-Why? Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay? That's more like it! Oh, I want to be in that rumba When the saints go over there Oh, over there! "Make videotape for Maggie.
" What a surprise! We were just pulling taffy.
-The fun never stops here, does it? -No, sirree bob! -Flanders, can I borrow the camcorder? -Okey-dokel! Why don't you guys come over for a barbecue tomorrow? -No, thanks.
-We have a propane beauty -in the backyard.
-No.
-It's crying out to cook up good food! -Flanders, I said-- Tomorrow? Sure! What the hey? I'd love to come to your barbecue.
I'll even bring the thickest, juiciest T-bones you've ever seen.
Sounds terrif! The joke's on him! I'll be dead by then.
I am trying to.
Is that it? This is a videotape for my daughter, Maggie.
Hey, Maggie! I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave.
Hope that didn't scare you.
Maggie, you're grown-up now.
Unless you taped over this, you probably wonder about your dad.
He was a simple, kind and gentle man who loved his children and-- D'oh! Hello? Yeah, he's here.
Who is this? Milhouse? Bart! Get your butt down here! -Dad! -It's you.
What do you want? -We've never been close, have we? -Not to my knowledge.
Never went fishing, played catch or hugged.
We never danced the hootchy-koo either.
I just want you to know that I love you, Dad! -You do? -Uh-huh.
Oh, son, I love you too! How about a hug? -Dad! -Sonny boy! -Papa! -Junior! My old man.
I gotta go.
No! We've got a lot of catching up to do.
How about we go fishing? Gee.
If I wasn't on such a tight schedule.
Let's get some worms.
Well, no time for that.
I really wanted to do that one.
Gee, Dad, hog my last moments.
Just a quick game of hacky sack.
-I love you, son! -The old guy's a little love-starved.
Move, you hunk of junk! Gotta make up for lost time! D'oh! I'm sorry.
I know I was going too fast.
Just give me a ticket.
-Beg your pardon? -The ticket! -That sounded like an order.
-I pay my taxes.
They pay your salary.
When I say give me a ticket, just give me a ticket! -Maybe we don't wanna give it to you.
-Maybe we wanna haul your butt in.
Look what else your tax dollars pay for.
That's sort of nice.
What are you in for? Atmosphere.
Okay, Flash.
You get one phone call.
I can't call Marge.
It's our last day together.
I can't drag her into this mess.
I'll call Barney.
Nobody's here! Nobody's here! Damn those answering machine tapes! Thanks! I just wasted my only call on your stupid-- I'm home! I'm home! -Hi! -Help me.
I'm in jail.
You are? Hey, Homer, go to the window.
Hey, neighbor! I can see you! -Get over here.
Bring 50 bucks for bail! -50 bucks? What did you do? Kill a judge? Where am I gonna get 50 bucks? Pizza! -Why are we all dressed up? -Sometimes it's fun to dress up.
-Why are we using the good china? -Sometimes it's fun to use it.
-Why candles? -Sometimes candles are fun.
-Why wait for Dad? -Because we love him -and we enjoy his company.
-Why are we really waiting for Dad? Forty-eight dollars and 70 cents.
We don't usually take rusty money.
You're dying and you wouldn't even stop to have a beer with your buddies? It was on my list with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today.
Hey, my boss! Check out the luscious pair on that redhead.
-That's it, baby.
Work those ankles! -Ring-a-ding-ding, sir.
-Burns! Eat my shorts! -Who the Sam hill was that? It's Homer Simpson.
One of the schmoes from sector 7-G.
I want him in my office at 9:00, Monday morning.
We'll see who eats whose shorts.
Of all the luck.
I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.
Oh, Homer.
Come on! You've got time for one last beer.
Please! I gotta call Marge.
Moe's Tavern.
Birthplace of the Rob Roy.
-Is Seymour there? Last name Butts.
-Just a sec.
Hey, is there a Butts here? A Seymour Butts? Hey, everybody.
I wanna Seymour Butts! Wait a minute.
You scum-sucking pus bucket! When I get you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew! It was busy.
Moe, another last beer, please.
Guys, keep it down.
I've got some last words.
I never told you, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile.
So often I think that-- Oh, words won't do it.
I love you, Moe! Not in public! -You'd better be dying! -I love you! -How European! -Come on! I gotta get home! -Faster! Faster! -I'm twirling as fast as I can! I can't wait any longer.
Hold on, Marge.
I'm coming home! Where can he be? Marge! Marge! I don't have an explan-- Love you, love you, love you! I wrote a poem for you this afternoon.
-It's called, "To a Husband.
" -Okay.
The clouds are forming Give me a break.
Soon the rain will fall My dear one is departing But first, please heed this call That always will I love you My one, my love, my all That was beautiful! Goodbye, Maggie.
Stay as sweet as you are.
Goodbye, Lisa.
I know you'll make me proud.
Goodbye, Bart.
I like your sheets.
The Good Book.
On tape? Oh, it's read by Larry King.
I'm Larry King.
In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.
The earth was without.
--begat Phinehas.
Phinehas begat Abishua.
--begat Ahimaaz.
Ahimaaz begat-- Amariah begets Ahitub.
Ahitub begets-- And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children.
Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
That's it.
Duke Zeibert's standing by.
We'll get some matzo ball soup.
I love the Spurs.
If you're betting, they're gonna win it all.
I guess there's nothing more to say but-- Homer? Homer? Oh, Homer.
Homer.
His drool, it's warm! He's alive! Homer! Homer, wake up! -You're alive! -Stop it! -Wake up! You're alive! -What are you talking about? -You're alive! -I'm alive! I'm alive! And I couldn't be happier! From now on, I vow to live life to its fullest! -Three in a row! -Let's see that again.
-Here we go.
-Excellent wrist action.
It was just about to go into the gutter and made a nice spin.
Well, if he makes this, he'll be down by 40 pins.
The match is far from over.
Yes, it is, but his approach has been wrong from the beginning.
He's erratic.
He tends to explode.
-In Illinois.
-Actually, that was Michigan.
Well, he's stepping up now.
He needs to get at least a spare.

Do you have to sit so close? It'll hurt your eyes.
-It will not.
-Oh, yes, it will.
Our next movie is McBain a shoot-them-up, splatter-fest from the Hollywood cookie cutter.
Here's a brainless scene.
Senator Mendoza is a respected citizen.
Yet you ran his limo off a cliff and drove a bus through his front door? I have proof that he's head of a drug cartel! I don't want to hear it, McBain! You're out of here! That makes two of us.
-All right, McBain! -Cool! "That makes two of us.
" Are we talking about the same movie? McBain was a nonstop roller coaster of chills, thrills, spills and kills.
That chase at the end-- That movie stinks like your creepy apartment.
-Your mother didn't think so.
-Real mature-- I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
-What gives? -Dad, do something! All right, all right.
Time for Dr.
TV to perform a little surgery! Looks like you lost the patient, doc.
Shut up.
Cheap Chinese TV, why'd I ever buy it? Is that better? No! How's this? Oh, no.
Okay.
Just everybody remain calm.
If you look close, you can make them out.
Yeah, I think I can.
You're staring at a dot.
She's right! She's right! Oh, how I miss TV! Dear God, give me one channel! It's not the end of the world.
Before we got married, we hardly watched TV.
You lie! It's true, Bart.
We used to shoot pool and go dancing.
How romantic! And we'd stay at home and talk, like this.
I ain't loving it.
It's hard to picture you at the crossroads of life.
So many questions.
-Pick one.
-Okay.
How did Dad propose to you? Oh, well.
I think we found the reason why you've been throwing up in the morning.
-Congratulations.
-D'oh! I'd rather tell you a different story.
How your father and I first met and fell in love.
We were seniors in high school, but we'd never met.
Gross.
Hey, Homer, you're late for English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England.
Let's smoke.
I'm for equal rights, but do we need an amendment? Don't you deserve to earn as much as a man who does the same job? Not if I have to do heavy lifting or math.
Oh, Marge, you really ought to read this.
The shop kids are smoking again.
-We're late for wood shop! -Let's go grab a burger.
Boy, you don't gain a pound.
It's my metabolism.
I'm one of the lucky ones.
Well, if it isn't Simpson and Gumble, Springfield's Cheech and Chong.
Three days of detention.
You know where and when.
I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost $48,000 a year.
Right on, sister! The first step is to free ourselves from these male-imposed shackles! Yeah, mama! Take it off! -I didn't think it'd burn so fast.
-It's the paper.
Ms.
Bouvier, I am surprised.
One day of detention.
You know where and when.
-No, I don't.
I've never really-- -3:00, old building, room 106.
Hi, Estelle? Will you go to the prom with me? I wouldn't go if you were Elliott Gould! -Shot down again.
-Don't worry, it's a big school.
There's gotta be a girl nobody wants to take.
Excuse me, is this room 106? -Hey, who's that? -I don't know.
-Hey, would you like to go--? -She's mine! -So what are you in for? -I'm a political prisoner.
Every day, I show up, act like me and they slap me in here.
Simpson, be quiet! -I haven't seen you in school.
-Okay, Simpson.
-What? -Another day of detention! -Let's get together.
-Two days! -What's your name? -Homer.
-Three days! -J.
Simpson.
-Five! -It was worth it! Six days! Okay, Simpson, to the back of the room! -Love at first sight! -Jailhouse romance.
I reached step one.
She knew I existed.
The problem was, she didn't care.
-What's the matter? -Nothing.
Usually, I have to wrestle the bucket out of your mitts.
-Dad, I'm in love.
-Why don't you grab yourself a beer? -But, Dad, I don't drink-- -Cut the crap! "I collect the cans.
" Now grab a beer and get me one too.
This girlfriend, is she a real looker? -A lot on the ball? -Yeah.
Oh, son, don't overreach! Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl! I blame myself.
I should've had this talk a long time ago.
Thanks, Pop.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, l, J, K, L, M, N, O, P-- S.
I need some guidance, counselor.
Okey-dokey.
Good Lord, you should've come to see me a long time ago.
I met this girl, Marge, and I wanna force her to like me.
That's not the type of guidance I give.
I like to think I do something helpful for every student.
The only advice I can give you is to share common interests and spend.
What interests does she have? She's active on the forensics team.
They meet in room 219.
-Far out! -Do you have plans after graduation? Me? I'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night! I meant career-wise.
That nuclear power plant will be opening soon.
It's an outfit that won't require a college education.
Me, in a nuclear power plant.
Kaboom! But bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation.
Now, the more you help him, the more you hurt him.
Woe unto Shelbyville, should they underestimate our strength.
Thanks, Artie.
I'd like to sign up for something.
-We've an opening on the debate team.
-Arguing? I'll take that, stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs.
Bloominstein.
The topic is "Resolved: The speed limit should be lowered to 55 mph.
" Fifty-five? That's ridiculous! Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late! Why don't you take "con"? No way.
-Our speed limit is an anachronism-- -Ignoramus.
-Will you shut up? -That word you call me-- -Ignoramus? -It means I'm stupid, doesn't it? -Stupidity is different.
-Not to me.
-Ignoramus.
-You are.
-Would you like to do your rebuttal? -With pleasure.
Ay, carumba! You may not remember me.
I mooned for rebuttal.
-Yes, I remember.
-So you wanna go out with me? Well, I don't think you're my type.
You see, the problem is, you don't know me.
I have references.
Just ask Coach Flanagan.
And ask Mr.
Seckofsky and Barney Gumble! I don't know.
I'm not asking you to like me or let me touch your goodies.
Just be fair.
Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah.
Junior varsity shot-putter.
I think if he applies himself, trains real hard, he could go another foot.
I had him for four years.
Solid "C" student.
Made a lamp last year.
He's all things to men and maybe to a lucky gal.
Wanna go to prom with me? -Good God, no! -Well put.
Well, what's the good word? I'm sorry.
You seem like a nice guy.
But I really don't have the time.
And the forensics championship is coming up.
-So? -And I tutor part-time.
-You tutor? Anyone can be tutored? -Only in French.
French? What a coincidence! Just the subject I'm having trouble with.
-Why, you cagey old dog! -Great story.
Work, damn you, work! Bart! You may be telling this one day if something breaks.
Lost a few.
There's plenty more where that came from.
Uh-oh, a zit.
No problemo.
The perfect crime.
-Why is there make-out music on? -It helps me study.
Not me.
Shut it off and let's get down to business.
-Crayon.
-Bien! -FenÃªtre.
-Bien! -Femme.
-TrÃ¨s bien.
I should be going.
I have a big forensics meet tomorrow.
Wait, wait.
Don't go.
Wait.
Wait.
Why don't we take a little study break? -Do the hustle! -Keep it down! You're amazing.
Now you can conjugate all the regular verbs two irregular verbs, and sing "Alouette.
" -Bien.
-I can't believe it.
It's sticking.
You're telling me new stuff and minutes later, it's still there.
When I see you forming vowels and continents-- -Consonants.
-With your beautiful mouth and teeth-- Merci, I guess.
Marge, would you go to the prom with me? You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before.
You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Will you go out with me? Say oui.
-Oui.
-This will be the greatest night! I've been saving up, but I'll spend it all on us! I'll rent a limo! I'll buy you a corsage! My tux will have the widest lapels and the highest platform shoes.
Maybe I'll wear my hair up.
Wait, Marge.
If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this.
I'm not in any French class.
This was a brilliant scheme to get to know you.
You knew the City Forensics Finals are tomorrow and you kept me up until 1 a.
m.
Pretending to be stupid! Homer J.
Simpson, I hate you! Hey, Barney.
Guess who's got a date for the prom?! I know this story doesn't end with you telling it to us.
They married, had kids and bought a cheap TV.
Bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation.
-Now, the more you help him -Terrible.
the more you hurt him.
Congratulations, Artie.
This may not be an appropriate forum for what I'm about to put forth but would you go to the prom with me? I can think of many cogent arguments.
The first is from Time magazine: "America's Affair With the Prom.
" "Even wallflowers can date--" The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years.
I'll go to the prom with you.
If you pinch your cheeks, they'll glow.
Try to break some capillaries.
-Couldn't we just use rouge for this? -Ladies pinch.
Whores use rouge.
Is Marge here? -Who--? -Or what are you? -I'm her date.
-I suppose you wanna come in.
-Okay.
-Marge's dates always get homelier.
That's what you get when you don't put out.
I usually insist on approving Marge's dates, but you're a solid citizen.
Thanks, Mr.
B.
Here she comes.
Get the camera ready.
Homer? -What are you doing here? -You said you'd go with me.
I said I hated you, and we haven't talked since then.
I was afraid you'd cancel so I stayed away even though it meant skipping school and graduating this summer.
-I'm Artie, Marge's date for the prom.
-Well, hello.
-Well, hello, hello.
-Don't we look handsome? -Indeed we do.
-Come in, young man.
Wait a second.
If he's your date, who are you? I'm a spare.
Excuse me.
Now that that unpleasantness is over, let's take a picture of the couple.
Say "Cheez Whiz.
" -Hey, buddy, where's your date? -She's with him.
I guess you want me to take you home? I paid for this car, tuxedo and the two dinners! We're going to the prom! Prom, it is.
Don't dance too closely, now.
Have a good time.
Wait a second, is that a bong? You have asthma? All right, move along.
I thought you dropped out.
-You wish, Dondalinger.
-That's Mr.
Dondalinger.
-Steak or chicken? -Both.
-Coming through! -Barney! He's bought himself a decade of detention.
Children, we've tabulated your votes.
The king and queen of Springfield High School's class of 1974 are Artie Ziff and Marge Bouvier.
Oh, isn't she great? Hail, Queen Marge! Long live the queen! Hello, classmates.
Instead of voting for an athletic hero or pretty boy you have elected me, your intellectual superior, as your king.
Very well said.
Your king and queen will share their first royal dance.
Why do birds suddenly appear? -Every time you're near? -I've gotta get out of here.
-Homer? -What? Why are you doing this? Why can't you accept that I'm here with someone? Because we were meant to be together.
Usually when I have a thought, there's others.
Something says yes and no.
This time, it's only yes.
How could the only thing I've ever been sure about be wrong? I don't know, but it is.
-Where to now, Romeo? -Inspiration Point.
I'm only paid to drive.
Artie, I don't know.
It was a beautiful evening.
Let's not ruin it.
-Just this.
-Artie, please.
-Come on, kiss me.
Please.
-No, really, I mean it! Now stop it! -I'm sorry, Marge.
-Take me home.
It's 1:00.
If you wanna keep me, I'm afraid it's gonna be $45 an hour.
-No, it's okay.
I'm broke.
I'll walk.
-Yeah, why spoil a perfect evening? I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anybody about my busy hands.
Not so much for myself, but I'm so respected it would damage the town to hear it.
Good night.
Yeah, right.
When Simpson showed up, it took years off my life.
Stop it.
She went out with the good one.
Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go! All right! All right! I'll walk in the mud! -Homer? -Marge? -Yeah.
You want a ride? -Sure.
When I got home, I realized who I should've gone with.
Who? Oh.
-Hi, prom date.
-Marge, pour vous.
-Why so glum? -I got a problem.
Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and I'll never let you go.
And I never have.

-Evening, Carver of Graven Images.
-Homer the Thief.
How's business? Been a little slow.
Not much to steal in the desert.
Do not worry.
We'll be wandering out here another two weeks, tops.
Zohar the Adulterer.
My wife sends her regards.
-Yes, she's a good woman.
Very good.
-Thank you, my lusty friend.
-Moses is back.
-Quick! Everybody, look busy.
The Lord has handed down to us I will read them in no particular order.
-"Thou shalt not make graven images.
" -Oh, my God! -"Thou shalt not commit adultery.
" -Well, looks like the party's over.
Hey, Moses.
Keep them coming! "Thou shalt not steal.
" Sorry, Homer.
That's the most dishonest thing I've ever heard! I should box your ears! -You sneaky Pete! -Easy, tiger.
You, easy.
Get off my property! Flanders, who put that bug up your butt? I wanted to subscribe to the arts and crafts channel.
They sent this man to install it.
You know what he did? He offered to hook me up illegally to every channel for $50.
Boy, what's this world coming to? -That's exactly-- -Gotta go.
Hey, stop, cable man! Stop! -What do you want? -I want free cable! This is okay.
Everybody does it, right? What? If you're having second thoughts, read this.
"So You've Decided to Steal Cable.
" "Myth: Cable piracy is wrong.
Fact: Cable companies are faceless corporations which makes it okay.
" The clown that will last a lifetime.
Cable.
It's more wonderful than I dared hope! Don't you hate it when you go to the toilet and there's no toilet paper? It's funny because it's true! Oh, hey! Family! Family, come here.
I have an announcement to make.
The Simpsons have cable! Cable?! Right.
68 channels.
MTV for the kids.
VH1 for us.
1600 hours of quality programming every day.
We've talked about cable before.
You think we can afford it? Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that.
Is this legal? Don't worry.
Look at this.
"Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies.
" Fact: Most movies on cable get two stars or less "and are repeated ad nauseam.
" -I don't know.
-Marge.
Hear Me Roar, the network for women.
We'll teach you to lower your bill by making your own Band-Aids.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Before we begin, you'll need Pro wrestling from Mexico.
Down there, it's a real sport.
This is where Jaws eats the boat.
Here, Die Hard jumps through the window.
This is where Wall Street gets arrested.

I refer you to page 4500-- They think people watch that.

This is the World Series of Cockfighting! Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou tonight.
We'd get there quicker if I drove my dad's car.
-Aren't you ready for church, Homer? -Huh? What? Okay.
Today's Christian doesn't think he needs God.
He thinks he's got it made.
He's got his hi-fi.
His boob tube.
And his instant pizza pie.
Oh, pizza.
Children, I don't want you to get frightened but I must teach you this.
Today's topic will be hell.
I sat through mercy and forgiveness.
Finally, we get to the good stuff.
Hell is terrible! Maggots are your sheet, worms your blanket.
There's a lake of fire burning with sulfur.
You'll be tormented.
If you actually saw hell, you'd be so frightened you would die.
-Miss Albright? -Yes.
-Won't you eventually get used to it? -No.
-Yes.
-Are there pirates in hell? -Thousands of them.
-Oh, baby! So there's a downside to the afterlife.
How does one steer clear of this? By obeying the 10 Commandments.
Ten simple rules that are easy to live by.
-What did you children learn about? -Hell.
I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell -unless I say "hell.
" -He has a point.
Hell, yes! Hell, hell, hell, hell.
Bart! You're no longer in Sunday school.
Don't swear.
Hey, anybody up for a little so-called pay-TV? -Are you sure this isn't stealing? -Read the pamphlet.
Hello, I'm Troy McClure.
You may remember me from Cry Yuma and Here Comes the Coast Guard! I'd like to talk about a candy that cleans and straightens your teeth! A program-length advertisement! Wait a minute.
I'm confused.
Did you say "cleans and straightens"? There's no confusion.
Just good science.
Ladies and gentlemen, the inventor, Dr.
Nick Riviera.
-Thank you, Troy.
Hi, everybody! -Hi, Dr.
Riviera! Now, could I have a volunteer? Somebody with crooked, yellow teeth.
Come on, Lisa.
Watch a little cable with us.
It won't cost you a thing.
Except your soul! -What's gotten into Lisa? -Beats the hell out of me! -What are you doing? -What do you mean? -Remember the 8th commandment? -Of course.
Thou shalt not.
Covet graven images.
Something about covet.
Thou shalt not steal! Anything else? Yes.
I ate two grapes.
Please charge me for them.
Two grapes? Who cares? -Just charge me something, please.
-Okay.
I need a price check on two grapes.
You heard me, Phil.
Two measly, stinking grapes.
If you didn't catch it in the theater or rent it we've got it! On the Blockbuster Channel! Why is the world a cesspool of corruption? Oh, great.
All right, what makes you say that? In Sunday school we learned stealing is a sin.
But everybody does it.
We're stealing cable.
-Did you pay for your breakfast? -No.
-Did you pay for your clothes? -No, I didn't.
Run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the feds! -I think that's pretty spurious.
-Well, thank you, honey.
Friday night, live.
The ultimate matchup.
The bout to knock the other guy out.
Watson-Tatum Two.
This time it's for money! -Oh, boy! -Only on the Blockbuster Channel.
How can one little insulated wire bring so much happiness? Big fight coming up.
Wanna come over and listen to it on the radio? Okay.
After the fight, we can watch the still photos on the news.
Not too shabby! What do you say? We could do that, yeah.
Or we could go over to my house and watch it live on cable TV! -Get off! -You're kidding me! Pass the pumice, please.
He's Homer from sector 7-G.
Excellent.
I'm so keen on seeing Watson vs.
Tatum Two I'd even go to an employee's house.
I can picture it now.
The screen door resting off its hinges.
Mangy dog staggering about looking vainly for a place to die.
-May I speak frankly? -Yes.
-You are quite wealthy.
-Thank you.
Your candor is refreshing.
Why don't you pay for the fight yourself? The big fight is one of those rare occasions that I savor the sights the sounds and the smells of other men.
You haven't lost the common touch.
-So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.
-That's right.
-8:00, my place.
Come one, come all.
-All right.
Moe, how come you never got cable for the bar? Well, it was either cable or the mechanical bull.
I made my choice and I stand by it.
-Somebody's having a party.
-Friday night.
Wanna come over? No, thanks.
I'm open 24 hours.
It puts great demands on my time.
Too bad.
It'll be a great fight.
The fight! I'll get my brother, Sanjay, to cover for me.
He deplores violence.
If a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that's stealing? No.
It is if he puts anything on it.
Jelly, for example.
I see.
You're here for a reason.
Is your father stealing bread? I don't watch him every minute.
But we're getting cable for free.
I'm afraid that is stealing.
I think you must do something.
-Should I have him arrested? -That seems like an ideal solution.
But remember the 5th commandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother.
" I would like to see you set an example by not watching -the offending technology yourself.
-Thank you.
You're watching Top Hat Entertainment.
Adult programming all day, every day.
Except in Florida and Utah.
Coming up next, Stardust Mammaries.
-Ay, carumba! -Bart! -Here's what I was looking for.
-Blue chips closed up 3 3/4.
Oil service stocks slumped.
You shouldn't watch that other channel.
It's for mommies and daddies who love each other.
-Promise me you won't ever watch it.
-Okay.
-Promise me.
-I promise I won't watch it.
-Good boy.
-Hi, Dad.
Stealing cable is wrong, so I'm not watching it in the hope that others will follow my example.
Thank you.
Hey, Lisa.
Racing from Belmont? Horsies! Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.
There's something wrong with that kid.
She's so moral.
Why can't she be more like? Well, not like Bart.
-But there's gotta be a happy medium.
-Well, you know.
Bart was looking at that racy movie.
And Lisa is losing a little respect for you.
Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable.
-Unhook it? But I love cable! -Then you should pay for it.
I can't afford it.
When I can afford to pay for it, I will.
But I can't so I'm not going to.
Cable has become an evil presence in our home.
Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
But I'm severely tempted to do it.
-No.
-I'm sorry, it's coming down.
-No.
-It's coming down.
That's it! It's coming down! The cable stays.
The foot has spoken.
-Lemonade? Please.
-Seen it.
-Cleans and straightens-- -Seen it.
-Seen it.
-I was poor.
Soccer.
Seen it.
-Simpson.
-How did you get in? Your door wasn't locked well enough.
Would you be interested in this stereo? A $500 value.
You can have it for $40.
-Get out! Criminal! -I'll go see a neighbor.
-He's not home! -Even better.
You sure about this? Doesn't look friendly.
Can't be too careful.
Thieves are everywhere.
I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.
Come one, come all! Top Hat Theater is on the air! The most beautiful women! Just 50 cents! I'm your host, Bart Simpson! You must be at least And now The Top Hat Channel is proud to present Broadcast Nudes.
-Gross! -Yet strangely compelling.
-It's a raid! -What the--? I know you.
Come back here! You promised me you wouldn't watch that trash.
Go to your room! I wish I was an adult so I could break rules.
Oh, great.
-I brought some imported generic beer.
-Thank you, Barney.
-How many people are coming? -Just a select circle.
Hello! I brought an assortment of jerkies.
-Did you swipe those from work? -Certainly not.
What are you implying? There is no love lost between these two warriors.
We almost had a scuffle today at the weigh-in.
You have a special motivation going into this bout.
I want to dedicate this fight to my manager, Vinnie, who got me here and then -passed away two weeks ago.
-Any response? I would also like to dedicate this fight to this manager.
-You can't! -I can! You dedicate the fight to your manager! I want to tell you that I'm not watching this fight.
It's my form of nonviolent protest.
Hi, Homer.
I brought you-- Quick! It's Moe.
I gotta hide the mugs.
Will you get--? Hey, go protest outside, will you? Now! -Hi.
I brought you a mug.
-Thank you.
I always wanted one of these.
Oh! Mr.
Burns! -Hide the stuff I borrowed from work! -Borrowed? -Okay, that stuff I stole from work.
-Oh, okay.
Come on! Take all this.
Put it in the closet.
Will you quit staring at me like that? Hello.
We were in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
Hello, Mr.
Burns.
Like to watch the fight? The fight! Don't mind if I do.
Oh, Simpson.
Good news.
I brought some munchies.
Smithers, the Cheetos.
In but a few scant minutes, the anticipation-- -Simpson? -Yes.
-You have an illegal cable hookup.
-No.
No, l-- It wasn't me.
It was my wife's idea.
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey.
Settle down, fella.
We were hoping we could watch the fight.
Oh, sure, sure.
Be my guest.
-Here's lemonade for your protest.
-Thanks, Mom.
-It isn't going very well.
-Don't give up.
When you love somebody, you must have faith that they will do the right thing.
He learned how to fight in the projects of Capital City and honed his skills while serving time for assault in Springfield Prison.
All right! A local boy! For 5 years, I was away from my kids and their mothers.
The conditions were irrevocable.
Assault.
Manslaughter.
Stealing cable TV! Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Shake hands.
Keep it clean.
Come on, boy! Excuse me.
I hate to interrupt your judging me.
I've made a couple of important decisions.
Number one: I'm cutting the cable when the fight's over.
Number two: I'm not very fond of any of you.
-Back to the fight.
-Get down! We may have saved your soul.
Tatum is reeling! Yeah, at the worst possible time.
Eight! Nine! Ten! This fight is history! It's done! A stunning knockout by a thunderous punch in the 12th round.
Tatum is the new champion of the world! Everyone to my place for squishies and microwave burritos.
Best fight ever and I missed it.
We're really proud of you.
-What a donnybrook! -Hogwash! I once watched Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo bare-knuckled for 113 rounds! Back then, if it was less than 50 rounds, we demanded our nickel back! -Cable clippers.
-Here you go.
-Go for it, Dad.
-I beg you to reconsider.
Tractor pulls.
Atlanta Braves baseball.
Joe Franklin! Third time's a charm.

Hey, Homer, did I wake you? I'm up! I'm up! I wanted to tell you about a new BBQ joint.
Oh, BBQ! It's called Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit.
I can still taste the sauce.
And get this: -It's all-you-can-eat! -This is like some beautiful dream! And one and two and three and reach and five and six and-- Marge, I've got five words to say to you.
Greasy Joe's Bottomless BBQ Pit.
You promised you'd only have six servings of pork a week.
I'm only human.
Now look, here's what we're gonna do: We'll take the kids to your sisters' Saturday night.
Then we'll eat till they kick us out! Saturday night? I'm not sure they're available.
I'll take that bet.
Hello, Marge.
Saturday, we're going to Stanley Peterson's wedding.
Although he's going at her like they're already married.
Hey, alley cats.
Save it for the honeymoon! Well, if you have other plans.
It's no problem.
We'll leave before they toss the bouquet.
"F.
" "L.
" No, I'm sorry.
That's a "C, " isn't it? If that was a car, you'd be dead now.
-But driving is my livelihood.
-Take it like a man.
Friends, relatives, work-related acquaintances we are gathered here to join Stanley and Martha in holy matrimony.
Martha, my dear, I remember the first day that I met you.
-Hello, Selma.
-Hello, Stanley.
-Is this seat taken? -Yes! Hey, beat it! Had I not chosen that seat, Martha, my love who knows what woman I might have ended up with? Poor Brandy.
Aunt Selma? -Will you ever get married? -I don't know.
-Why? You know somebody? -No.
I'm sure you'd resent my pity, so I'll hope you're one of the statistically small number of single 40-year-olds who find their fair prince.
Patty! Selma! We're home! I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever met me! Marge, I need to speak with you.
Oh, and that sauce, Barney! I could have drunk a bowl of it! No, that's just my sister-in-law.
I'll get right to it.
I'm getting older and uglier.
Please, Marge, help me find a man before it's too late.
Well, I'll try.
Do you remember when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin? Remember? Who could forget? Then you'll also remember you owe me a favor to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.
-But that was just an idle promise.
-Not to me! -I want you to find Selma a husband.
-Find a husband?! Wait, which one's Selma? She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and walking in the park on autumn days.
I thought she was the one who didn't like to be touched.
Patty chose celibacy but Selma simply had it thrust upon her.
-But Marge-- -Homer, you will find her a man! -Okay.
-And not just any man! He should be honest and caring and well-off and handsome! Why should she have a better husband than you? Sodium tetrasulfate is caustic and can remove your skin.
Say when.
-When! -What's this for? It's used in making rayons, film and as a preservative in fast foods.
-It's also a potent herbicide.
-What's a herbicide? -It kills grass.
-Excellent.
Must find man.
Must find man.
Must find man.
Boy, a good man really is hard to find! According to my sources, you are simultaneously planning to drop your pencils at 2: 15.
Do so and you will be suspended.
-Who squealed? -You can't get anything past him.
He knows everything.
Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats.
-He'll never get away with it.
-He just goes too far.
One seafood burrito, Apu.
The time has come for money to change hands.
Oh, sorry.
Say what they will about our cafeteria I still think they're the best Tater Tots money can buy.
Wait a minute that smells like sodium tetrasulfate bonding with chlorophyll.
Sweet Lord, it is! Simpson! Surely you knew that by writing "Bart" in 40-foot letters you would be caught.
-Maybe it was another Bart.
-There are none! The sheer contempt makes me wish I could use the board of education.
Call your father.
-Is Homer there? -Homer who? Homer Sexual.
Wait one second, let me check.
Homer Sexual! Come on, one of you guys has got to be Homer Sexual! Don't look at me! You little punk! If I get ahold of you -I'll rip your face off! -You'll do what, young man? What? Wait.
Who is this? The question is, who's this and where is Homer? Sorry, Principal Skinner.
It's a bad connection, I think.
For you.
I think Bart's in trouble again.
What now? The victim is the grass on groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field.
If it's okay with you I'd like to punish Bart through backbreaking physical labor.
Re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.
But enough about Bart.
Tell me, are you married? Only to my job.
But if you weren't, you'd tend to go for a girl? These pants come off at night just like everybody else's.
Why all the questions? Oh, no reason.
I was just wondering if you'd like to come over to my house for dinner.
A payback for all the things Bart has done! Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace.
-I'd be delighted! -Excellent.
Good evening and welcome to our home.
I only hope we can put our differences aside for the next few hours.
Just get inside already.
He's here.
What are you waiting for? Go shake your moneymaker.
I'm too nervous.
You do it.
-No, you do it.
-No, you do it.
I had a discomforting thought on the way here.
This dinner wouldn't be a plan to set me up with some unmarried relation, would it? Because I can-- Be still, my foolish heart.
Here we go.
Boy meets beast.
Allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely -and available sister, Selma.
-Hey, tubs, I'm Patty! -What? -Patty.
D'oh! Wrong one.
So, Patty, tell me, tell me more about your trip to Egypt.
Nothing more to tell, really.
The Nile smells and the horseflies are huge.
Marvelous.
Just marvelous.
Well, Selma hated Egypt too.
A camel spit on her.
They can be difficult.
Patty the Parents Advisory Board asked that I see Space Mutants Part V.
Would you be interested in joining me? -I don't-- -She'd be delighted! -I'll cancel.
-No.
We already had plans.
Your first date in 25 years is more important than playing cards.
I tried to repel him, really.
Pack of Lady Laramies.
It could easily have been me.
Very easily.
Laramie Hi-Tars, hard pack.
Here you go.
Smoke them in good health.
Any lottery tickets with that? No.
All right, five.
Stupid Principal Skinner.
You gotta be kidding me.
Save your strength, lad.
There's a whole field for you to re-sod yet.
Bart, you wouldn't know what sort of candy your aunt likes, would you? -Cherry cordials, sir.
-Oh, very good.
Now then, regarding your punishment, have you learned your lesson? Have I ever.
The thought of doing wrong makes my stomach turn.
Well, you're free to go.
Willie, you can take it from here.
AdiÃ³s.
You haven't seen the last of Willie! I don't see why this is necessary.
You don't want to show up for your big date looking like Yosemite Sam.
How do I look? Achingly beautiful.
Cherry cordials.
I hope you like them.
They're okay.
Let's get this over with.
Let's start with the Springfield Revolving Restaurant.
Food tastes better when you're revolving.
-This evening has been disappointing.
-Indeed.
Terrible.
Hey! Can we get some service over here? I keep asking for water.
-Is everything all right? -Little Jimmy Pearson.
-Class of '71, right? -Principal Skinner.
Get this woman a glass of water! And tuck in your shirt.
Nearly 30 and still working as a busboy! Standardized testing never lies.
I'm not surprised.
She's always the lucky one.
Two minutes younger.
Skin like a china doll.
Bosoms till Tuesday.
Don't worry.
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Right, Homer? Oh, yes.
Plenty of fish.
We just don't have any bait.
Don't be stupid! Sorry.
Oh, come on, love, loosen up.
I can't forget what happened to that poor dingo.
What could've done it? It was probably just a wallaby.
Now come on.
Well, okay.
Hello, Dolly.
Oh, that was the worst movie I've ever seen.
Not as bad as the service at the revolving restaurant.
Isn't it nice we hate the same things? -So, see me again tomorrow? -That's my microwave cookery class.
-Then the day after that.
-Oh, gee, tae kwon do.
-The day after that? -You're touching me.
Kiss me, Patty.
I don't have cooties.
Thursday, I'm going food shopping.
You can come if you like.
Until then.
I want every detail.
Or is your tongue too tired? The movie was awful and he didn't get anything.
Now good night.
One kiss.
But I don't want you bragging to your friends.
Oh, I wish I could make a P.
A.
announcement to the whole world.
Attention! Seymour Skinner is in love! -That's cool.
-Skinner's gonna kill you! -Skinner? He works for me now.
-Simpson? What is that there? Patty.
I hate to pull you away from your exercise but I wanted you to be first to know.
-I plan to ask your aunt to marry me.
-Your funeral.
Homer, lighten up.
You're making happy hour bitterly ironic.
I gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma.
I'm intrigued.
What does she look like? -Like my wife's ugly sister.
-Wheel her in, Homer.
I'm not picky.
-The rule of thumb is 2 years' salary.
-I can't afford that! I'll take it.
My sister's not going out with Barney Gumble! She's no prize pig herself, you know! -Bart, come cheer up your Aunt Selma.
-Okay.
What did you learn in school? Principal Skinner's gonna ask Patty to marry him.
Thanks, kid.
You made my day.
But nothing! She's a heifer, plain and simple-- There's the little prom queen now.
Can the sweet talk! You're right.
It's time to end my girlish dreams and grab hold of the next train out of the station.
Is that Selma? Ring-a-ding-ding! -Oh, shut up.
-Why are you all dolled up? It takes a ripe piece of cheese to catch the mouse.
It's time to give away my love like cheap wine.
Take it to the hoop, Selma.
Hey! Look what I brought! -Schnapps? -I'll take that.
You seem preoccupied, my little pudding cup.
My sister's on a date with a big, fat rummy.
There's something up here that will pick up your spirits.
"Marry me, Patty"? Jeezum Crow! Look at the size of that rock! The second most precious jewel here.
Patty, will you marry me? -I don't know.
I mean-- -Just say whatever's in your heart.
It's not that I don't love you.
You love me! -Yes.
Yes, but-- -But? But I'm a twin, and as such I have a-- Special tie to your sister! Any man I could marry would have to-- Understand that you couldn't leave Selma.
Yes.
So I know you appreciate why you can never.
-See you again? -Exactly.
It's kind of a Catch-22.
Farewell, my Patty-cake.
Good night, sweet principal.
Oh, Springfield Elementary, I will have you back again! After all, tomorrow is another school day! And then when I got out of the service.
Well, the next few years are a blur.
Where's Skinner? We decided we loved each other enough never to see each other again.
I hope I can find a man like that.
Are you throwing away happiness for me? -Yes.
-Thanks.
-Now let's go get some pancakes.
-Listen, Barney.
She broke my heart, Moe.
Don't worry, Barney.
Time heals all wounds.
What do you know? You're right.
And look, a whole pitcher to myself.
I told you you'd be back!

Let's move on to new business.
Have you taken care of McBain? Don't worry, Senator Mendoza.
By now our dear friend has met with a shall we say, unfortunate accident? Great.
With McBain out of the way, nothing can stop us! Any more new business? -Only your death! -McBain! McBain! Meeting adjourned.
-$2.
50 for this? -What a gyp! You broke up that meeting.
Now I'm thinking about holding another meeting in bed.
Oh, McBain! I want to see the manager! -The screen's small! -The floor's sticky! -The subplot felt tacked on.
-We demand a refund! -It's not our policy.
-I'll policy you! -Don't have a heart attack, old dude.
-Don't you tell me what to do, you young whipper snapper! Thanks for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality -at least in this country.
Amen.
-Very nicely said.
-Bart ate during the blessing! -You opened your eyes.
-Eating is worse.
-Is not! -Is too! -Is not! One more word and Bart gets no cartoons and Lisa can't go to college! -Dad! -Not one word! -Knock it off.
-We didn't talk.
-Not a word.
-No panto-ma-mine, either.
-Telephone, Homer.
It's the hospital.
-The hospital? Hello? Oh, my God! I'm happy to say that he only had a mild arrhythmia.
Mild! There wasn't anything mild about it! Now get back to the pharmacy, you quack! With that feisty attitude, you'll bury us all, Grampa Simpson.
-Pull your chair closer, my son.
-What is it, Dad? Not that close! Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die someday.
Oh, Dad! You and your imagination.
There's something I think you should know.
You have a half-brother.
A half-brother? It all happened while I was courting your mother.
I was checking out the skirts at the carnival when I first saw her.
Hey, handsome, wanna dunk the clown? She did things your mother would never do.
Like have sex for money.
A year later, the carnival came back and she had a little surprise for me.
We left the baby at the Shelbyville orphanage, and I never saw him again.
A year later, I married your mother and we had you.
I want Homer to grow up respecting his father.
He must never know about that carnival incident.
-Promise you won't tell.
-I promise.
Forget what I just told you.
-Why are you blubbering? -This makes me feel special.
Since I'm the one you kept, it means you really love me.
-Interesting theory.
-I'm going to find my brother.
If I have to move heaven and earth, I'm going to find him! Yeah, right.
Good luck.
A long-Iost half-brother.
How Dickensian! Know where this bastard lives? His parents aren't married.
-It's the correct word, isn't it? -He's got us there.
-Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! -Bart! -Bart! -Bastard! -Excuse me, is this an orphanage? -You're a little late.
-They tore that down 30 years ago.
-Thirty years! I'll never find him! I'm doomed to walk through this life alone.
Oh, brother, where art thou? -Easy.
They moved across the street.
-Sorry.
I know how you feel.
I've spent years searching for my long-Iost twin brother-- Yeah, but we're looking for my brother today.
Can you tell me his name? Our records state the Powells adopted him and named him Herbert.
Herbert Powell, great! Where can I find him? Sorry, I'm not allowed to say.
Please! This is my life we're talking about here! I do sympathize with your situation, Mr.
Simpson.
Your brother could be anywhere, even Detroit.
I know he could be anywhere! Narrow it down, please! If you ask me the city of brotherly love isn't Philadelphia, it's Detroit.
Changing the subject makes you a worthless excuse for a human being-- Read between the lines, you fool! I get it! Here's 20 bucks.
Now, will you tell me where my brother lives? -I don't-- -Take it and tell me! -He lives in Detroit.
-Fine.
Thank you.
Let's see, Powell.
"Pomerantz.
" "Poole.
" "Popkin.
" "Potter.
" "Quigley.
" "Quimby.
" "Randolph.
" Oops, too far.
Here it is, "Powell"! -Any luck? -No.
I called all three Herbert Powells, nothing.
Well, you want to try that H.
Powell? "H" ! Of course! That could stand for Herbert! It's a long shot, but-- Is this H.
Powell of Detroit, Michigan? By any chance does the "H" stand for Herbert? The "H" stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted? -From the Shelbyville Orphanage? -How did you know? Because I'm your baby brother, Homer! -Hello? Hello? Stupid phone! -Knock it off! I'm here! -I was silent due to emotion.
-Sorry.
We need to meet.
Grab a plane to Springfield.
We got a couch that folds out-- I'll tell you what, why don't you come here? -Are we there yet? -Just a little further.
-We there yet? -Just a little further! If you don't behave we'll turn around and go home.
-But, Marge, I want to see my brother! -Homer, it's an empty threat.
Did you know you were going--? Sorry, sir, I didn't know it was you.
That's okay.
Carry on.
See the way I handled that, Marge? -What are you doing here? -What does it look like? We're losing to the Japanese.
Why? -Unfair trade practices? -Mushy one-worlders in Washington? -Some gypsy curse? -I'm tired of excuses! -Why did I hire Harvard idiots? -You went there.
But Mommy and Daddy didn't pay my way! I had to work, washing your dishes and toilets! I remember you.
-What's the name for our new car? -You'll love this.
The Persephone! Persephone? What the hell kind of name is that? She was the Greek goddess of spring and rebirth.
She was carried off to Hades where she ate six pomegranate s-- People don't want cars named after hungry, old, Greek broads! They want names like Mustang and Cheetah, vicious animal names.
The problem is, you've forgotten your roots! What are your roots? I guess they extend to when the Angles met the Saxons.
When white met bread.
What are your roots? What can they teach us? I have no roots.
All I know is that I'm just a Ionely guy.
-What was he so upset about? -Good Lord.
Marge, this can't be the right address.
-Hello, in there.
-Homer? -Herb? -You look just like-- Except you got a little more-- And a little less-- God, I feel so-- -Herbert! -Homer! -Welcome to my home, brother.
-Holy moly! The bastard's rich! Herb, allow me to introduce my family.
This is my wife, Marge.
-You old dog, she's gorgeous! -Thank you.
Our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.
-All born in wedlock? -Yes, but Bart was a close call.
Lisa, are you the hell-raiser your father told me about? -No, I can assure you I'm not.
-I'm the hell-raiser.
-Do you want to hold the baby? -I don't know how.
Oh, what's to know? Just dive in.
Catch! God, that new-baby smell.
Homer, you're the richest man I know.
I feel the same about you.
I want you to make yourselves at home.
Any time you're hungry, day or night, Cook will make you anything you want.
-Even pork chops? -Absolutely.
We've a tennis court-- If I want pork chops in the middle of the night, he'll fry them up? Sure.
That's what he's paid for.
If you need towels-- Wait! Let me see if I got this right.
It's Christmas day, 4:00 a.
m -there's a rumble in my belly-- -Homer! -You sure love pork chops! -He sure does, Uncle Herb.
"Uncle Herb" sounds so formal.
Do you think you could call me "Unky Herb"? -No problemo, Unky Herb.
-He's adorable.
My nephew's adorable.
-Marco! -Polo.
Will you kids shut up? So, Marge, a little about yourself.
I met Homer in high school.
We married and had three beautiful children.
Wow, we have so much catching up to do.
I just told you pretty much everything.
-Watch me dive! -Okay, we're watching! I hope we're not spoiling them.
-You weren't watching! -You didn't see! A millionaire! I kept the wrong one.
I'll come as soon as I can leave here.
In the meantime, please don't do anything stupid.
Can I spit over the side? I love this kid.
Hawk your brains out.
Got him! Cook? Sorry to bother you, but I got a hankering for-- That's right! With applesauce.
-Pick out any one you want.
-You sure you want to give me a car? You know what they cost me? There's maybe $40 worth of steel in them.
-Okay, I'd like a big one then.
-We don't have a big one.
-Why not? -Americans don't want big cars.
-Give me one with lots of pep.
-Our cars don't have pep.
-Why not? -Americans want good mileage.
Tell the nice man what country you come from.
-America.
-You hear that, morons? This is why we're getting killed! Instead of listening, you're telling people what they want.
-I need your help.
-You do? Yeah.
I want you to help me design a car.
A car for all the Homer Simpsons out there.
-I want to pay you $200,000 a year! -And I want to let you! Homer, meet my team of engineers.
They're gonna build your car.
-Hi, team.
-This project is our top priority.
I don't want to see anything till it's finished.
But, sir-- Direct all your questions to Mr.
Simpson the man with the vision.
He'll bust this company out of its rut.
He'll change American transportation forever! -So, what kind of car would you like? -I don't know.
Whatever you kids want to do today, tell me.
-Oh, dear.
-I want a pony ride.
-I want a boat ride.
-Pony ride! -Boat ride! -Pony ride! Ahoy, mateys! -Kids are so easy to please.
-I hope we're not spoiling them.
-What's that? -The onboard computer.
All right.
What's that? -Your brother told you to help us.
-Yeah, he did.
-Why don't you get us some coffee? -Okay.
Batting ninth, Unky Herb! -Oh, boy.
-How's your car coming? We're putting in an onboard something and rack-and-peanut steering.
Homer, you didn't ask for rack-and-pinion steering, did you? I think I did.
How could you ask for it? You don't know what it is.
-May I be excused? -No.
You know why I gave you this job? -You think I'm a genius? -No, not that.
-You think I'm dynamic? -I don't think so.
-You think I work well with others? -No.
It's because you're an average schmo.
-All you need is self-confidence.
-Unky Herb, I don't know-- Listen to me.
From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself: "If nothing else, I'm sure of this!" -Understand? -Sort of.
-Homer! -What? -Answer with self-confidence.
-Sort of! Now go get them! I want a place in this car to put my drink! -Sir, the car has a beverage holder.
-Hello, Einstein! I said a place to put my drink.
The Super Slakers they sell at K wik-E-Marts are this big! -Very big beverage holder.
-I'm not done! The little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car.
Little ball.
Some things are so snazzy they never go out of style.
Tail fins -and bubble domes.
-I gotta call the boss.
Hello.
Well, you know what? I'm glad you're nervous because that means we're on the right track.
All right! This is what you're gonna do.
Hang up and call me back.
Say the exact opposite of everything you just said.
Kids, come here.
-What is it? -Hear what the guys think of your dad.
-Hello.
-Homer Simpson is a brilliant man with lots of well-thought-out, practical ideas.
He's ensuring the financial security of this company.
Oh, yes, and his personal hygiene is above reproach.
-Our dad's the greatest! -Homer, I'm impressed! Pretty good, huh? Put a horn here, here and here.
I can't find it when I'm mad.
-And they should play "La Cucaracha.
" -Can do.
Sometimes the kids are in the back hollering.
There must be something we can do about that.
A built-in video game? You're fired! What are we paying you for? A separate soundproof dome for the kids? With restraints and muzzles.
Bull's-eye! And when I gun the motor I want people to think the world is coming to an end! The mouse is named Itchy and the cat is Scratchy.
-They hate each other.
-They express it.
Good.
To think I wasted my life in boardrooms and meetings.
I could have been watching cartoons! This old fool's wasted his life.
-Do you miss the Antarctic? -Now this is spoiling them.
No.
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed stockholders members of the press, Your Holiness.
Tonight we are going to witness automotive history.
Whatever Homer wants All my life, I've looked for a car that feels right.
Homer gets Powerful like a gorilla, yet soft like a Nerf ball.
Now I've found it.
Presenting the car designed for the average man the Homer! -Questions? -What does this monstrosity cost? Jerry, what's the sticker price? $82,000! This monstrosity costs $82,000? What have I done? I mean, the zoo was fun but I'm ruined! -Bye, Unky Herb.
-Goodbye, Herb.
Because of me, you lost your business, your home and all your possessions.
Maybe you'd have been better off if I'd never come into your life.
Maybe I'd have been better off? Maybe? You sponge-head, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother! Maybe he said that to make conversation.
His life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a Simpson.
I'm here! Where's that millionaire chip off the old block I call sonny? Get in, Dad.
I'll explain on the way home.
I knew you'd blow it! -Dad? -What is it, boy? I thought your car was cool.
Thanks, boy.
I was waiting for someone to say that.

No! No! Bad dog! Let go! Bad Santa's Little Helper! Stop! Not the sports section! Stupid dog! No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food! Time to get up, Lisa.
It's a school day.
Lisa, you don't look well.
I'll make it, Mom.
Just tape my lunch box to my hand.
My, you're burning up.
And your cheeks are so swollen.
I think you have the mumps.
I'll call Dr.
Hibbert.
-The dog is hungry.
-Well, then, feed him.
Yes, master.
You're my best friend.
You're my best friend.
Hello, Dr.
Hibbert? Not that I'm angry, but how did you get my home number? I see.
Quite ingenious.
I think Lisa has the mumps.
Well, Mrs.
Simpson I'd like to rely on your diagnosis, but it'd be derelict of me to do so.
Let me check my schedule.
No way, she's faking.
If Lisa stays home, I stay home.
-lf Bart stays home, I go to school.
-Fine, then-- Wait.
If Lisa goes to school, I go.
But if she stays, I stay, so -Lisa goes to school.
-Don't confuse him.
-Have a nice day at school.
-Get my homework.
Homework? Lisa, you wasted chicken pox.
Don't waste the mumps.
-Bart-dude! -Hey, Otto-man! -Yo, hairy bro.
-Go home, boy.
Go home.
Wandering mongrel.
Get out of my mom-and-pop operation.
-Hello? -This is Sylvia Winfield.
Your canine is in my pool again.
I'm calling the dog warden.
Are you? You go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old axe because my dog is tied up! There's only one family on Earth inconsiderate enough to let that monster roam free! Are you going deaf, or are you just stupid? I'll explain one more time, and then I'm going to hang up on you.
It is not my dog! I tied my dog outside myself! I am looking at him right-- Well, how-doodlie-do.
Getting some exercise? Good for you.
Look at this rascal.
He's a wet boy, isn't he? You're a water monster.
Well, well, "Mr.
Universe" takes a walk.
"Mr.
Universe, " I wish.
Look at that get-up.
Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and-- -Assassins! -You bet.
They've got Velcro, a water pump, built-in odometer, and vanity plates.
-How much? -Well, they're not giving them away.
-But you've got to spoil yourself.
-Yeah.
My heart rate's dropping.
Better skedaddle-y-do.
-Discoloration of the glands.
-Oh, dear.
-Swelling of the parotids.
-I knew it.
Lisa has the mumps.
You'll be missing a week of school.
Oh, no.
I don't want to fall behind my class.
Such responsibility.
What's your favorite subject? Arithmetic.
Arithmetic.
Before you know it, you'll be back among your polygons and your Euclidian algorithms.
You get rest and have a lollipop.
Hello? Hi, Lisa, what's wrong? The mumps? Oh, the kissing disease.
My little girl is growing up.
Yuck.
Quit it, Dad.
So, what does my little girl want? What? Let me write this down.
Copies of Teen Dream, Teen Scream and Teen Steam magazine? Well, okay, you're the sickie.
Goodbye, Lisa.
Lenny, I need to leave.
Cover for me.
Hey, sure thing, Homer.
Well, Lisa, here it is.
The Bouvier family quilt.
Wow, neat.
It smells historic.
For five generations, women in our family have added to it.
Now it's your turn.
-I don't know how.
-You do, you just don't know it.
The memory of a million drop stitches flows in your veins.
-Very impressive.
-You try it.
You just need to develop a callous.
You see? Now that's a sewing finger, honey.
Oh, man, $2.
00? I'll take these three.
-They're for my daughter.
-Sure.
Wise guy.
Assassins! Oh, 125 bucks! Sometimes you've gotta spoil yourself.
-But I can't-- -Simpson! -I order you to buy those shoes! -You're the boss! -This one's mine.
-"Keep On Truckin' "? -What does that mean? -I didn't know then.
I don't know now.
Here's your stupid homework.
Phonics, functions, vocabulary, remedial reading? Do your own homework, Bart! Your magazines.
How many of these guys are Corey? Eight.
Thanks, Dad.
-Assassins! -Yep.
Read 'em and weep.
-Those are very elaborate.
-They better be, for $125.
-$125! -Bart! We agreed to consult before major purchases.
You bought those smoke alarms, and we haven't had a single fire.
A manhunt, or "woman-hunt", is on-- You know, yours is the only show I'll do.
As an actor, my eyes need to look their whitest-- It's a penalty kick-- Shoelace.
No! There seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here.
School's your answer to everything.
This one looks very reputable.
Lovely.
Have a toffee.
Such a neat dog.
Have at them.
Well done.
If I could borrow -"Satan's Little Helper.
" -Santa's Little Helper.
Ladies and gentlemen.
You already know that with a little love any puppy will grow up to be a bundle of joy.
Nonsense taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits! I'll tell you the most important words you'll ever hear choke chain.
Raise a dog the same as a child, with simple, authoritative commands.
Lay down! Followed by immediate correction.
How can we tell we're doing it right? The dog's eyes will cross, and his tongue will protrude slightly.
Is my dog dead, ma'am? You don't know how often I'm asked that.
They are always breathing.
Jack, I think the baby might be yours.
I'm sure it is.
-But prove it.
-You treat me like garbage.
Because that's the way you love it, baby.
Gee, is it always this good? I don't know.
I just dip in and out.
I'm only watching because Brandy knows the body is hidden in the boathouse.
That dog! Bad dog! Don't worry, Snowball.
Mom, what will we do if the dog doesn't learn anything? I don't know.
-Father! I thought you were dead.
-I was! There are two ways for a dog to relieve himself.
One, like a friend.
The other, like a hose without a fireman.
Which way do you think that was? Like a hose, you wrinkled queen.
I decided I don't want the shoes.
What happened here? My dog was bringing me my shoes, and they fell apart in his mouth.
Our warranty doesn't cover fire, theft or acts of dog.
Big cookie.
-Aloha.
-Aloha.
-Want a free sample? -The price is right.
Macamademia nuts.
If you'd like to buy, they're $1.
So that's your little plan! Get us addicted, then jack up the price! Well, you win.
Property of Homer J.
Simpson.
Hands off! Mom, I've finished my patch.
It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.
On the left is Mr.
Largo, my music teacher.
He taught that the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty.
On the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy.
He taught me that music is a fire that comes out your mouth.
So you better stick an instrument in front of it.
And look.
I want you to see what your sick little girl did.
My quilt! Six generations, ruined! Now, Marge, honey come on, don't get upset.
It's not the end of the world.
We all loved that quilt.
But you can't get too attached to-- My cookie! This is not happening! We're having a family meeting! We never did this before.
We never had a family member we can give away.
-What are you saying? -I'm saying-- No! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair, rip my clothes! I've suffered at the paws of this dog but when I look into his vacant eyes, I can't bear to let him go.
I'm sure Mom agrees with me.
No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.
You do? Please.
It's not just the quilt.
He's nice, but he chews everything.
He's not even housebroken.
We've spent money on training, with no improvement.
All right.
If he studies hard, passes finals, and becomes a perfect dog -can we keep him? -No! -Dad! -Dad! This is our pet.
We can question his disposition, but we can't question his heart.
Is the way to solve a problem with something you love to throw it away? If they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner.
All right.
If he passes, we can keep him.
All right! See, boy? It's not so hard.
Roll over.
Roll over.
Like this.
Congratulations, you've earned a toffee.
Thank you.
You moldy old maid.
Can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test? No, we have to commit to it.
Now take this down: Free to loving home, world's smartest dog.
Says "I love you" on command.
Type.
Now, sit! I said, sit! Take a walk.
Sniff that other dog's butt.
See? He does exactly what I say.
We'd never give him away, but we're moving, and dogs are forbidden.
Hear what? Oh, sure.
Come here, boy! Put that prowler down and come here! Come on! Say "I love you" for the nice man.
Good dog! Isn't that amazing? See you soon.
You think your dogs know the "stay" command.
Let's see if they can stay away from this beef Wellington.
Now, stay.
Stay, boy! Stay! Stay! He'd be happy at my farm.
People think only mules can pull carts.
Impatient people think that, patient people know better.
You can take him tomorrow.
Miss Winthrop, I was thinking.
-Oh, dear.
-Since you get paid either way would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass? I see.
Rubber stamp, thank you, next in line.
Is that it? -Yeah.
-Heavens to murgatroid.
Perhaps I cling to the old ways like a well-chewed shoe as the traditions I was weaned on are put to sleep, one by one.
But my time has not passed yet! We do not need another college graduate who doesn't know how to sit! He'll sit! Come on, boy.
Sit! Pull the chain! Correct the dog! -I don't want to strangle my dog.
-Pull the bloody chain, boy! I'm sorry.
You can't help being dumb.
-What are you doing? -Sewing a new quilt.
It's one thing to be a link in a chain.
It's another to start one.
This patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt.
Well, you certainly captured the moment.
Come on, boy.
Sit! Sit! -Sit! Oh, man.
-Bart, he's not gonna learn it now.
Don't spend your last hours together tormenting him.
Have some fun.
Frolic with him.
Go get it, boy! I'm gonna miss you, boy.
I thought we'd be pals forever.
But we have to say goodbye because you don't understand a word I say.
If you knew how to learn-- Sit.
Wait a minute, you did it! Lay down.
Shake hands.
Stay! Speak! All right! Good boy! Roll over.
You son of a bitch! Good show! All right!

Next time we'll do something more fun.
Oh, what could be more fun than today's trip to the liquor store? Thanks for the jerky! -Say goodbye.
-Bye.
Good-- Grampa smells like that trunk with the wet bottom.
-He smells like a photo lab.
-Stop it! Grampa smells like an old man, which is like a hospital hallway.
That's terrible.
We should teach them to value the elderly.
-We'll be old someday.
-My God, you're right! You kids won't put me in a home? Well.
What'll we do? -I think we better set an example.
-Absolutely! Our Sundays should be a pleasure.
Where's a fun place we can take Grampa? -To the pony ride! -No.
-Boring.
-He can't sit.
I enjoy the glass blower at Old Springfield.
He saw that.
Big yawner.
The Museum of Barnyard Oddities! -No, Bart! No! -That's gross.
I got it! The Mystery Spot! It's just a dumb mud puddle.
Discount Lion Safari! Like I'm gonna ruin $600 teeth on 40 cents' worth of beef.
These aren't my pills! Now, Mr.
Simmons.
Don't make me call Nurse Bronski.
It's Simpson, and these aren't my pills.
Excuse me.
My name is Simmons.
I have the wrong pills.
I get two red for my back, a yellow one for my arrhythmia and two of the bluest eyes I've ever seen in my life.
-These must be.
-I have your.
They must have.
Look at us.
We're staring like a couple of stupid punk teenagers.
Oh, I wasn't staring, it's, uh, my lazy eye.
I'm Beatrice Simmons.
My friends call me Bea.
Well, I'm Abraham J.
Simpson.
Care to tip the wrist with me? I would be delighted.
So, tell me about yourself.
Widower, one son, one working kidney.
And you? Widowed, bad hip, liver disorder.
You left something out: Ravishing! -What are you doing tonight? -Sitting alone in my room.
If you've got plans already-- -No! What were you saying? -Nothing.
Abe.
You were going to say something.
I was wondering if you and l, you know might go to the same place.
-You'd think this would get easier! -I'd love to.
Okay, now where's that pomade? Ah! "Never fly solo again.
" Aw, damn! Out of pomade.
Oh, well.
Oh, hello, young lady.
Is your grandmother home? Oh, Abe.
I'd better keep my good eye on you.
Damn straight.
Herman, a special lady is having her birthday tomorrow.
The battleship New Jersey.
You idiot! My girlfriend, Bea.
Since this is the only store I know-- Nothing says "I love you" better than a military antique.
Take a look at the bayonet case.
-Hey, what's that? -That was Napoleon's hat.
-It doesn't look it.
-Not the famous one.
He wore it for a week in 1796.
Before he beat the Sardinians.
How much? -$400.
-I'll give you $5.
Not an offer you should make to a man with a gun.
Try Grandma's World.
Activewear, I need a price check on a wool shawl.
Dad! It's Sunday.
You know what that means.
-Go away! -Oh, come on, Dad.
I promise we'll have fun.
We're gonna see lions.
I can't.
It's my girlfriend Bea's birthday.
Oh, you have a girlfriend.
Well, happy birthday, Bea.
She can come with us.
There's room for all your friends.
She's not invisible, you idiot! -It's her birthday tonight.
-Right.
-Stop kicking the seat! -I'm kicking it! -You want to know where we're going? -No.
Discount Lion Safari! Damn these childproof doors! -Hello.
-That'll be 18.
50, Bwana.
"Do not feed or allow animals in car.
Do not make eye contact.
" Are we in Africa yet? -This place sucks.
-The animals are sleeping.
Let 'em sleep on their own time! Are you sure this is the way? The road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy.
What a wingding.
This is much better than my girlfriend's party.
Bart, get out and push.
-Yeah, Bart, get out and push.
-No way! Okay, we've seen a lion.
Can we go now? Oh, Bea! Mr.
Simpson, I presume.
-I got a date with an angel.
-You don't know how right you are.
-What? -I'm sorry to tell you this, but -Bea passed away last night.
-Oh, no.
The doc said her left ventricle burst.
No, Jasper.
They may say she died of a burst ventricle but I know she died of a broken heart.
I can tell she really cared.
She didn't make me a pallbearer.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Is someone talking? I didn't hear anything.
Oh, no! Dad's lost his hearing! No, you idiot! I'm ignoring you! You made me miss the last moments of Bea's life.
I'll never speak to you again! I have no son! Oh, Bea.
It was a beautiful service.
-Who are you? -Lionel Hutz, attorney.
I'm the executor of the estate.
Bea was wealthy and-- Surprise, surprise! She left it all to you.
-Really? -There is one catch.
You must spend one night in a haunted house.
Just kidding.
Here's a check for $106,000 "To enjoy as you see fit.
" Oh, I'm touched.
-$106,000! -Ta-ta, Mr.
Simpson.
By the way, I do wills.
Here's a pen with my phone number on it.
It looks like a cigar.
Isn't that neat? Hello, Homer? Dad's on the phone! -Oh, Dad, I knew you'd forgive me.
-I haven't forgiven you! I just inherited $106,000 and I just had to tell you that you're not getting one thin dime! -Mr.
Simpson? -What is it? I couldn't help hearing about your money.
Let me assure you that here, money does make a difference.
There are rubdowns, and then there are rubdowns.
Listen, you bloodsucker! Does it ever occur to you that old folks should be treated like humans -whether they have money or not? -Yes, but it passes.
Oh, you lousy son of a.
I'll take it! Big spender, why the change? Bea told me to enjoy my moola and I'm going to, dagnab it! -Where to? -Take me someplace fun! You're the boss.
Next stop, Funsville.
-I miss Bea.
-I miss you too.
Oh, calm down.
I'm not here to scare you.
I'm haunting a family in Texas.
Oh, well, I'm glad you're keeping busy.
I want to know why my money isn't bringing you happiness.
Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out for the highlife.
If you're not happy, why don't you spread it around? Make other people as happy as you made me.
Oh, thanks, Bea.
I will! And your son misses you.
Oh, I miss him too, the big fat dickens.
Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you, what was death like? Not as scary as this! I miss my daddy.
This thing has had you moping around for days.
I think it's time for you to talk to someone.
You've reached Dr.
Monroe's Anxiety Line.
If you have a sullen teenager, press 1.
For spousal problems, press 2 now.
If you have trouble-- Grampa! -Dad! -Sonny-boy! Is there room at your table for an old man? Well, sure! We'll have to move a chair in, but it's no problem.
Bart! -Choose your corncob.
En garde! -Challenge accepted! All my precious sacks of gold couldn't buy me the joys of a family meal.
-Pass the bug juice.
-Wait your turn! I have an announcement.
I've decided to give Bea's money away to people who need it.
I'm gonna let them come to me and plead their case and then I'll decide.
That's the noblest thought ever expressed at this table.
-Give it to us.
-Bart! Forgive him.
He's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing in his head.
-You know, he is wise.
-You don't want it.
-I do.
-You ain't getting it! Not since my marriage to the weather lady has this town been so consumed with rumor and innuendo.
Here's why: Today, one Abraham "Grampa" Simpson announced that he'll give away over $100,000 to the person he finds most deserving.
Is Grampa Simpson a saint, a rich nut, or both? Time will tell.
Kent Brockman, on line for an old man's money.
You see, Gramps, I wanna customize the bus.
Chop the top, jack it up, put on wheels psychedelic paint job from hell.
Jam the kids to school! Here's a rendering.
Note the cobra wrapped around the naked chick.
Next! Grampa? -I can call you Grampa, can't I? -Go ahead.
I need that money.
Please--! Wait! You're the guy who owns the nuclear power plant.
-Ownership is divided-- -What are you doing? I dread the day when $100,000 isn't worth groveling for.
Get out of here! You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man.
Here's the deal, Grampa.
A guy I think was an explorer left this in the bar.
It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to a house.
To find out, we'll need money, provisions and a diving bell.
It's pretty stupid, but so far you're the front-runner.
It's an isolation chamber.
A subject pulls levers to get heat and food.
The floor can become electrified and water falls on the subject.
I call it the Monroe box.
Well, it sounds interesting.
How much will it cost? It's already built! I need the money to buy a baby to raise in the box.
To prove what? The subject should be maladjusted and harbor resentment towards me.
Interesting.
I want a tear gas pen, a blowgun with paralyzer darts-- -Oh, no! -Nunchucks.
Nunchucks? What are those? Radioactive Man number 27.
And I want that baseball card where the guy's flipping the bird.
-I've seen that one.
-And a monkey.
What the hell is that? Why, it's a death ray, my good man.
Behold.
-Hey, feels warm.
Kind of nice.
-Well, it's just the prototype.
With funding, this baby could destroy an area the size of New York.
-I wanna help people, not kill them! -Oh.
The ray only has evil applications.
My wife'll be happy.
She's hated this death ray from day one.
Oh, Lisa, what makes you think you deserve all that money? I don't deserve it, Grampa.
No one here does.
The people who deserve it are in the slums.
They're children who need books and families who can't make ends meet.
-But you can buy me a pony.
-You're right! I'll name her Princess.
No, you're right about the poor souls who need a helping hand.
I need to take a walk.
Oh, dear.
-Oh! I'm exhausted.
-Poor baby, been lifting your wallet? No! I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes! But $100,000 just isn't enough.
I need more.
Why don't you go on the gambling junket? You could double your money.
-Tempting.
-They got a 99-cent shrimp cocktail.
You've sold me! Trying to get us killed? It's too hot, maniac! Turn on the air already! Hey, mellow out, old dudes, or I'll jam this baby into a river! I'm looking for Abe Simpson.
It's important.
I don't care about his money, I love him! We get that a lot.
He left with the casino junket.
Casino! Come on, everybody! Hello, I'm Plato.
Please partake of keno, craps and the town's loosest slots.
My philosophy is: Enjoy! Change, please.
Burger, onion rings, shake! And for God's sake, hurry! $5000 on-- What century is this? -The 20th.
-Put it on 20.
Excuse me.
Have you seen an old man? He looks like me only wrinkled.
Have you seen--? Dad! No! -20 black.
-Holy moly, you're winning! You're cramping me.
Quit while you're ahead, understand? You gotta leave! -I have to get enough for everybody.
-But you could lose everything! Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best.
"If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn" and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss yours is the earth and everything that's in it "and, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
" -You'll be a bonehead! -Put it all on 41.
-I've got a feeling.
-The wheel only goes to 36.
Put it all on 36.
I've got a feeling.
Dad, no! Give me that money! Come on! Stop it! Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! -36! -No more bets.
Son, if this lands on 36, I'll.
Double zero.
Son! You saved me from losing all my money.
For the first time, I'm glad I had children.
So have you figured out who gets the money? Yes, Homer, I have.
Come on in.
Dignity's on me, friends.

Live from Mt.
Splashmore, the county's funnest water park -it's The Krusty the Clown Show! -Hey, kids! You know, today's the last day of our special week on location at fabulous Mt.
Splashmore.
I just want to say these people have been super to me and Sideshow Mel.
The food, the grog.
They threw a brunch with fresh fruit and the most delicious melon.
The thing I'll miss most is those special Mt.
Splashmore water slides, God bless them.
So fun.
So many memories.
Excuse me.
It has been a great week, hasn't it, Lis? Come out and pack this place, just to show them how grateful I am.
I told them you would.
Don't make me a liar! Okay, kids! It's time to.
I want to go to Mt.
Splashmore Take me, take me Take me now Now now now Now now Mt.
Splashmore Take me there right now -This is a rather shameless promotion.
-Worked on me.
-Will you take us to Mt.
Splashmore? -No.
-Will you take us to Mt.
Splashmore? -No! -Will you take us to Mt.
Splashmore? -No! -Will you take us to Mt.
Splashmore? -No! -Will you take us to Mt.
Splashmore? -No! If I take you, will you two shut up? -Yeah! -Of course! -Will you take us to Mt.
Splashmore? -Yes! Come on, Homer! Get the lead out! Homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination.
-Kids, I'm moving the seat back.
-It is back.
Everybody, stick together.
We don't want to get separ-- D'oh! Challenge the raging waters of death! Discover what water's really made of! -H-2-Whoa! -Whoa! All right! No line! Ay caramba! Okay.
Turn on the waterworks, babe.
Mommy! I want my mommy! Step aside.
Spread out.
Lost kid coming through.
Pardon me.
Moving to the front.
Nice work, babe.
No, Maggie! Stay in the shallow end.
The hell with this! Slide inspector coming through! Move to the right.
-Move! I'm here for your safety.
-God bless that man! Bitchen.
What? Come on, you stupid tube! There's a jam in Delta sector.
Too big to be human.
Send kids to dislodge it.
Roger.
Can't breathe.
Too many children.
Boo! Boo! Witnesses estimate the man's weight at 400 to 500 pounds.
On the lighter side of news, and I use the term loosely.
It's safe! This was an isolated incident! I understand, Krusty.
Isn't that what you said before the recall of Krusty-Brand Mayonnaise? That question is out of bounds.
Interview's over! All right, family.
I want the truth.
Don't pull any punches.
Am I just a little bit overweight? Well, am I? Forgive us, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response.
Four hundred thirty seven-- Fifty-five? My God! Three hundred and-- A hundred and fifty? Oh, my God! Two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big, fat pig! Now, Homer, you do have big bones.
Marge, no one gains I'm going on a diet! From now on there'll be no pork chop too succulent, no donut too tasty no pizza too laden with delicious toppings to prevent me from reaching my ideal weight! As God is my witness, I'll always be hungry again! D'oh! Shut up! This old attic's kind of spooky, isn't it? I said, isn't it? Don't ever do that again! Okay.
Get away from that and find my athletic equipment! -Homer, I found your weights.
-Oh, the Glutimus Maximizer.
-Who's the mop-top with the schnoz? -That's Ringo Starr.
What is this? Your mother must have painted this.
I guess she thought he was cute.
What? Hey! What the--? Marge! Don't be jealous.
I was a schoolgirl.
-The Beatles were very popular.
-A likely story.
Why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night? Homer, we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you.
Wait, I've been setting my drinks on these things! They're only 35 calories apiece.
Hello? Hello! Hello, taste? Where are you? -Put something on top, for flavor.
-Now you're talking! These paintings are good.
I know how fragile young talent is.
Tell me how your gift was squashed.
Well.
-Another one of that bongo beater! -Mr.
Schindler-- One might've used this canvas to paint a masterpiece.
Instead, you've soiled it forever.
-Now this is art! -Thanks, Mr.
Schindler.
I can't believe you gave up because of one small-minded art teacher.
I sent the portrait to the only man whose opinion I could trust.
And what was Ringo's response? I never got any.
I never painted again.
Take a class at community college.
-What do you think, Homer? -Do I have to do anything? -No.
-Great! Fine! Go nuts! Only 35 calories.
-Hello, Mrs.
Homer! -Apu, why are you here? I enrolled in Screenwriting.
I yearn to tell the story of a young Hindu pushed too far by Quik-E-Mart bandits: -It's Hands off My Jerky, Turkey.
-Clever title.
-Thanks.
My brother thought of it.
-Next up.
My mother would like to enroll in Painting from Life 2B.
Not so fast there.
No one can enroll until Mr.
Lombardo approves their portfolio.
-Lisa, this was a bad idea.
-Mom.
Very good.
Fabulous.
Even better! You have real talent.
You think so? My art teacher hated them.
What? The man was a fool! -I admire the force of his conviction.
-I'm in the class? There couldn't be a class without you.
If you'll excuse me, nature calls.
Marvelous! -The Heavy Hands only work if you move.
-I can't.
Oh, really? Now, using the Lombardo method you learn to see everyday objects as simple geometrical shapes.
Here, we see how two circles, various trapezoids, ellipses and yes, even a rhombus can create an adorable bunny rabbit.
It's just that easy! Lincoln, I've been thinking What have you been drinking? Is it water? Is it wine? Oh, my gosh, it's turpentine Bravo! Walk away.
Now it belongs to the ages.
Not another stroke! Oh, one more.
That's it! Perfect! Indeed.
You find the inner beauty of your subject.
-Thank you, professor.
-You're welcome.
Marge, walk with me.
They want me to submit a painting from my class to the art exhibition next week.
I've decided to choose your Bald Adonis.
Really? I wish every teacher was like you.
Marge, please.
I don't take praise very well! Oh! Another triumph! -I can't believe it! -Yeah, Mom! I'm a work of art! Last Supper, eat your heart out.
Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, housepainter? -Throw this on the dung heap! -I quit.
Well, I guess that's artistic temperament.
Sir, the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum -is six days away.
-Damnation! This is as half-baked as your idea about me having children.
Find me an artist.
You've systematically alienated Springfield's entire art community.
-The only one left is Mrs.
Simpson.
-Who? She's the wife of an employee.
She'll be easily intimidated.
Excellent! Once again, the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet bosom.
-Somebody up there likes me.
-Down here too.
Shut up! D'oh! D'oh! Two-forty-nine! Yeah! Marge! Marge, look at me! -My clothes are hanging off me.
-That's wonderful! Right, kids? I told you to show support.
-Way to go, Dad! -You look marvelous! Oh, what a family.
What gives? These donuts are piling up.
-Homer Simpson went on a diet.
-Oh, my God! And I just bought a boat! -Don't people answer the door? -Allow me.
Open up! Open up! Mr.
Burns! Would you like to come in? He'd like to commission a portrait.
-Have you painted the rich? -No, just Ringo Starr.
Ring Go? He was the drummer for the Beatles.
Beatles, eh? Oh, yes.
I remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show.
This commission and all of its glory can be yours but you must answer one question.
-Shoot.
-Can you make me beautiful? -That won't be a problem.
-I'm no matinee idol.
Maybe not, but I have the gift of seeing inner beauty.
Mrs.
Simpson, you may immortalize me.
At last, the world will see you as I always have.
Yes.
Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers.
Now, you, paint! -Honey, I'm home! -There's an original sentiment.
Take it outside.
I'm male-modeling.
-I'm painting his portrait.
-Isn't that wonderful? My work and my home life, come together in such a nice way.
Marge, may I see you? He thinks he's handsome.
You've gotta make him look handsome! Don't worry.
All I need to do is find Mr.
Burns' inner beauty.
What were you like as a boy? Did you have a dog that you loved? -Something's on my leg! Get it off! -Mr.
Burns, she's just a baby! All right, all right.
Who took the funny pages? So Ziggy goes to the repair shop.
There's a sign reading "Out of Order.
" Oh, Ziggy, will you ever win? Oh, my.
Excuse me! I'm changing for a meeting! I'm so sorry, Mr.
Burns.
-Did he have spots all over his body? -I heard that! Should I leave too, sir? Of course not, Smithers.
You're like a doctor.
Smithers! I want my tea! Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around? Actually, I value every second.
I squeeze his juice each morning.
I tuck him in at night.
He's not just my boss.
He's my best friend.
-Too hot! -Right.
It's scalding me as we speak.
"Dear Sally, in response to your letter of Dec.
12, 1966" me favorite color's blue, and me real name's Richard.
Thanks for the snapshot.
You're a real cute bird.
Love, Ringo.
"PS: Forgive the late reply.
" -Mr.
Starr, tea.
-Set it over there.
If you'll forgive me, your devotion to your fans is remarkable.
They took the time to write me.
Even if it takes 20 more years, I'm going to answer every one of them.
Hello! What's this? From Springfield, U.
S.
A.
Gear! -Cease that infernal tootling! -I was practicing.
It's hard to find your beauty if you're shouting at a little girl.
We've only got two days left.
Shut up and paint! Okay, scale.
We don't like each other but I've been good so treat me right! All right! Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and feeling fine I'm using the original notches! That's wonderful, Homer! I'm-- Let me get this straight.
You're pleased with your current appearance? You're the fattest thing I've ever seen and I've been on safari.
If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.
I've had enough of your posing! I can finish the portrait myself.
Another day and I would've needed a Valium.
Thank you for your hospitality.
See you at the unveiling.
What are you doing? Give me that! He's right.
What's the use? Don't listen to him! He's a mean little SOB.
Oh, Marge! -I thought there's good in everybody.
-Just paint a nice picture of him.
I don't think I can.
-Marge, you have to! -I can't make him beautiful! I guess I'm no artist.
Hello.
What's this? For you, Marge.
From merry ol' England.
-From the desk of Ringo Starr! -Dear Marge.
Thanks for the fab painting.
I hung it on me wall.
You're quite an artist.
Yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England but we call French fries "chips.
" Love, Ringo.
PS: Forgive the lateness of my reply.
Come on, Marge, paint! I think you can do it.
Okay, Homer.
If you think I can.
Friends, art lovers, security personnel.
It's a great day for the Palace of Fine Arts.
A new wing for our museum, and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold Montgomery Burns? Smithers.
I don't care for this at all.
Hello, my name is Marge Simpson and I painted this.
Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me.
I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr.
Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain there was a frail, withered body, perhaps not long for this world as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures.
Yes! Provocative, but powerful.
He's bad, but he'll die.
So I like it.
Marge, a word please.
You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate.
I don't hate this.
Your painting is bold but beautiful.
And incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia.
I thought I did.

Hear about Miss Hoover? She drank some drain cleaner.
I heard she fell down a well.
Come on, now.
She's been dumped again.
I won't be staying long.
I just learned I have Lyme disease.
Principal Skinner will stay until a sub comes.
-What's Lyme disease? -I know.
Lyme disease is spread by ticks.
When a tick begins to suck your blood spirochetes infest your blood and spinal fluid and then the brain.
The brain.
Oh, dear God! Come on, Elizabeth.
Well, now, children, here we are.
Open your primers to page 32.
Ah, subtraction! Bart Simpson, I know it's you! And here comes Snowball II.
We kept this one.
The mother ate the gray one.
Mrs.
Krabappel, he's traumatizing us.
I agree.
Bart, shut that off and sit down.
Look, this is cool.
When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
No, you're not seeing things.
This, my little friends, is a schwa.
-Are you the substitute? -I am.
-Are you insane? -It's how I get their attention.
All right.
Play friendly with your new teacher, children.
Howdy.
I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.
-Ask me anything you like.
-Can we play kickball? Kickball? There ain't no kickball in 1830.
Any other questions? Shoot! It's awfully quiet.
Well, how about this? I want to see both eyes up here.
There are three things wrong with my costume.
Name them and you get my hat.
-I know the answer.
-What's your name? -Lisa Simpson.
-Well, go ahead.
Your belt says "State of Texas, " but it wasn't a state until 1845.
Very good.
-The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
-Excellent.
You seem to be Jewish.
-You sure? -Italian? -Jewish.
-Cowboys aren't Jewish.
Good! I also have a digital watch, but I'll accept that.
For the record, there were some Jewish cowboys.
Big guys who spent money freely.
I'm Mr.
Bergstrom.
You can make fun of my name.
Two suggestions are Mr.
Nerd-strom and Mr.
Booger-strom.
Today we will begin selecting a class president.
I can't vote, but I suggest Martin.
Martin? As president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an ABC of the overlords of the genre: -Asimov, Bester, Clarke-- -What about Bradbury? I'm aware of his work.
Thank you, and keep watching the skies.
Excellent! Excellent, Martin! If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song? This one's not very accurate, but we'll fix it.
Okay? Actually, the range was far from home.
It was a desolate place of danger and disease.
Unlike the efficient Indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope.
What's this? Did you do it? No! I would never do anything like that.
It was one of those immature-- -Can I have it? -Yes, but I didn't do it.
-Are you sure you didn't? It's good.
-I wish I had.
Class, "The Singing Dork.
" Lisa! -Any more nominations? -We nominate Bart Simpson! Speech! I had a speech, but my dog ate it.
Children! Bart, I need someone to deliver a note to the principal.
-Would you do it? -But where's the principal's office? What did I say about encouraging him? When Bart wins approval for being a fool-- Yay, Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! "Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair" knew that a gray spider had played the most important part of all.
"No one was with her when she died.
" Come on, everybody has a talent.
-I wanna see yours.
-I don't have one.
There has to be something you do better than anyone.
-Well, I can do this.
-Yes! Great! How about you, Ralph? Wonderful! Chuck? Disgusting.
I love it! Lisa, you're holding out.
I see a saxophone! -I can't.
-Come on.
I bet you're good.
-I can't.
-Sure you can.
-Please don't make me do it.
-You owe me one.
While I'm technically married it hasn't been much of a marriage since Mr.
Krabappel moved out.
This profession can strain a marriage.
I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
Mrs.
Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Well? I'm sorry.
You're very nice, but it's the children I love.
Mr.
Bergstrom is the first thing I think of when I wake up.
I feel that way about Homer.
You don't understand.
When he smiles, you see these teeth.
But when he laughs, you see these.
The eyeteeth.
I don't know if he had braces, but they're perfect.
I notice little things about Homer.
Mom, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
-So does Homer.
-Mom, are we gonna talk or what? You have to accept that I feel that way about your father.
Fine.
Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web and cried at the end.
A book made him cry! Nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock that's volcanic, and one sedimentary.
-Lisa, can I see you? -Yes! Yes? Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you? -Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay.
My dad could-- -Not mine.
-Let me finish.
Unless the next word was "burp, " don't bother.
In a sample taken in our classroom an inspector found 1.
74 parts per million of asbestos! That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! -You made the front page.
-It's just a popularity contest.
"Just a popularity contest"? What's more important than popularity? -Bart, can you really win? -Sure, why not? I knew you had personality! They said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better! President Simpson.
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy? -Yeah.
-Now, go get them! He says, there are no easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough! You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.
-You'll miss Bart.
-When? When your life takes you places.
Places where my intelligence will be an asset? Yes, there is such a place.
Believe me.
I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.
"Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme disease.
We miss you.
Kevin's biting me.
Here's a drawing of a spirochete.
Love, Ralph.
" Oh, that's great, Ralph! The Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing down in two weeks.
Go see it while you can.
Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.
The museum? Tomorrow? Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on Sleeping? Eating a big sandwich? TV? Spending time with the boy! spending time with the boy.
-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too.
They're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.
-Homer, please.
You don't understand.
I can't-- You're trapped.
You're not smart enough to get out of this.
All right! I'll take her! Lousy brain.
-What's a "suggested donation"? -Pay what you wish.
-And what if I wish to pay zero? -It's up to you.
-So it's up to me, is it? -Yes.
And you think that people are gonna pay you $4.
50 when they don't have to, out of the goodness of their.
Anything you say! Good luck, lady! You'll need it! -Mr.
Bergstrom! -Hi, Lisa.
-Hey! You don't have to pay! -This must be your father.
His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.
Wow! Actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.
First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.
Gross! Creepy.
But I'd rather have him after me than the Wolf Man.
Oh, Lord.
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
-She said that? -No, but, you know, she-- But you can tell, right? She sees everybody else's dad with a good education and says, "What did I do to deserve this?" You must be a bigger man.
There's a wonderful girl's future at stake.
-lf she's so great, give her an A.
-I am.
-Great.
Tell her she earned it.
-She did earn it.
You are smooth.
I'll give you that.
He ruined my chance to get to know Mr.
Bergstrom outside school.
I'll tell you what, why don't we invite him to dinner? Oh, Mom, that's wonderful! -Can I help cook? -Yes.
-Can I wear jewelry? -Sure.
Dye my shoes? Paint my nails? Can we have wine? Can I have wine? Does Bart have to be there? We request the pleasure of your company-- No.
If you're not doing anything this Friday-- No.
Mr.
Bergstrom, do you like pork chops? Oh, no, of course not.
Good morning, Lisa.
I'm back.
My Lyme disease turned out to be -psychosomatic.
-Does that mean you're crazy? -It means she was faking.
-It was a little of both.
Sometimes when a disease is on the news, it's natural to think you have it.
-Where's Mr.
Bergstrom? -Don't know.
But I'd like to talk to him.
He didn't use my lesson plan.
-What did he teach you? -That life is worth living.
The polls are open till the end of recess.
In case any of you have thought about this we'll hear final statements.
Martin? I don't think there's anything left to say.
-Bart? -Victory party under the slide! Mr.
Bergstrom! Mr.
Bergstrom! He moved out this morning.
He took his Copernicus costume.
Where is he? He's taking the train to Capital City.
The train.
How like him.
Traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Yes.
And it's been the backbone of our country since Stanford drove in that golden spike.
I see he touched you too.
-Thanks for your vote.
-Voting's for geeks! You got that right.
-Thanks for your vote.
-We forgot.
Oh, well, as long as a couple of people did.
Right, Milhouse? Lewis? -Somebody must have voted.
-What about you? Didn't you vote? I demand a re-count.
Two for Martin.
Want another re-count? -No.
-I want to make sure.
One for Martin, two for Martin.
This way, Mr.
President! Now boarding the Afternoon Delight.
Mr.
Bergstrom! Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Lisa, indeed! -What? What is it? Were you just gonna leave, just like that? I'm sorry, Lisa.
It's the life of the substitute teacher.
He's a fraud.
Today he wears gym shorts, tomorrow he speaks French or runs a band saw or God knows what.
You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
-That's not true.
Others will come.
-Oh, please! You're right, I'm the best.
But they need me over in Capital City.
But I need you too.
When you're middle-class anybody who cares will leave to help someone needier.
I understand.
Mr.
Bergstrom, I'm gonna miss you.
I'll tell you what.
Whenever you feel alone like there's no one you can rely on this is all you need to know.
Thank you, Mr.
Bergstrom.
-All aboard! -So, I guess this is it.
If you don't mind, I'll run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life.
Goodbye, Lisa, honey! It'll be okay.
Just read the note! Bart didn't get one vote? This is the worst thing that could happen! All right, spilled milk.
What are you so mopey about? -Nothing.
-Lisa, tell your father.
-Mr.
Bergstrom left.
-Oh? -He's gone.
Forever.
-And? I didn't think you'd understand.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm glad I'm not crying.
I'd hate for you to think that what I'm gonna say is based on emotion.
But you, sir, are a baboon! -Me? -Yes, you! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon! -You don't realize what you're saying.
-Baboon! Someone was bound to say it, but I never expected her.
Did you hear that? She called me a baboon! The stupidest and ugliest ape of all! You're not allowed to be hurt now.
A little girl needs you.
Her confidence in you is shaken and no little girl can be happy without faith in her daddy.
"Go away.
" Lisa, don't hold anything back.
You can tell me.
-You're sad you called me a baboon? -No! Nuts.
This isn't going well at all.
-lf you want me to forgive-- -No, I just wish I knew what to say.
But maybe this music will help.
Now, you lost someone special and it hurt.
I never lost anyone special to me.
Everyone special to me is under this roof.
It's true.
Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life.
There's probably a place they hang out and the food is good, and guys like me are serving drinks.
Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse.
At least I'm good at monkey work.
You know, monkey? You know what I mean? I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
-You're so silly.
-Give me a banana.
-I don't have any.
-You're holding out on me.
-I'm sorry I called you a baboon.
-Think nothing of it.
President Prince, President Princess, President Priss.
Hey, what's the matter, son? Oh, Dad.
If just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted.
Would you have gotten any money for being class president? -No.
-Would you have more work? Yeah.
Is Martin gonna get to do anything neat like play in the World Series? -No.
-So, let the baby have his bottle.
That's my motto.
Hey, thanks, monkey-man.
Holy moly, talk about parenting.
Sleep well, Maggie.
Three for three.
-Did you straighten everything--? -Don't say anything, Marge.
Let's just go to bed.
I'm on the biggest roll of my life.

Mmm! "Hors doovers.
" -Homer! You promised.
-That I wouldn't eat? Never.
You lie.
Please! We've never thrown a party.
We'll pay back those who invited us to their homes.
What about that bash with champagne and musicians and holy men? -That was our wedding! -Oh.
It's time for bed.
-I want to hear your witty banter.
-You can't have fun in bed.
Oh, son, when you're older, you'll know better.
Oh, baby.
Mmm! Yeah.
-They're here! -How do I look? -Glasses? -Gag ice cubes? -Put a record on.
-What are their names? -Hi.
-Please come in.
You look swell.
And the house! You've done.
Whatever! Anybody mind if I serve as bartender? I have a Ph.
D.
in mixology.
College boy.
Care to try my Flanders planter's punch? Why not? I paid for it.
Next time put a little alcohol in it.
It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and a little crÃ¨me de cassis for flavor.
Well, I do have a warm sense of well-being, and I'm slurring my words.
-Give me another.
-Go easy on the alcohol.
Remember when you threw up in the laundry hamper? No.
Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you.
But I don't remember you being so beautiful.
A new kind of Mace? Really painful.
Oh, Dr.
Hibbert.
Enjoying the party? Not really.
Someone slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink.
-You fell for it! -Homer these ice cubes are made from highly toxic chemicals.
A real fly is more sanitary.
The look on your face.
It's priceless! -Bart! Come here.
-What? -You're a little monkey, aren't you? -Yes, sir.
-Do that cute thing you do.
-What? -That thing you know how to do.
-What? Go to bed.
Everybody! Look! I'm the funniest guy in the world! Oh, Homer! You're the king.
I've been wanting to tell you off for years but I never had the nerve.
I don't know you.
Our wives are friends.
We just met.
You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks.
I quit! -Gee, don't quit.
-All right.
Could you give me a -handful of peanuts, Maude? -Oh, sure.
Not those peanuts.
-The ones at the bottom.
-Oh, okay.
Thanks for inviting me.
I had a great time.
I apologize for my husband.
If you want him to live, roll him onto his stomach.
Thanks, I will, Dr.
Hibbert.
Remember, I said "if.
" I have never been so embarrassed in my life! Why? What did you do? Marge! Come here.
-Where are we going? -Shh! I don't want the kids to hear.
I always hated hearing my parents fight.
-They're fighting again.
-That music gives me the chills.
Do you remember the way you acted at the party? The way I acted? I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
-Well said.
-Thank you.
-A fly! -I put it there.
-You did? -I slipped it in.
-Pure hilarity! -Pure Homer! The most whimsical jape of the season.
I like to think that there's no line you could cross that could make me not love you.
But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it.
Can't we just forget it and go to church? I'm going alone.
You stay here and explain to Bart -why you scarred him for life.
-No, I didn't! l-- Oh.
You mean inside, don't you? You might have noticed Daddy acting strange and probably don't know why.
-You were wasted.
-I didn't know when to say when.
I just hope you didn't lose respect for me.
I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
Before a preview of next week's sermon I have some announcements to make.
We have some new pamphlets including "Satan's Boners" "Good Grief, More Satan's Boners, " and for teens, "It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell.
" Marge? Marge? The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer's shoes.
Why don't we wait until he sits? -Sorry.
-Sit down.
We will be holding our third annual marriage retreat at Catfish Lake.
Counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread or those in need of a tune-up.
To participate please sign up in the lobby.
Will the Simpsons be attending? Oh, well.
It's very tempting.
A wonderful idea-- Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?! Give me that pencil! -We'll be there.
-D'oh! Marriage encounter, here I come! -You want to go? -They're holding it at Catfish Lake.
They couldn't call it that if it didn't have a catfish in it.
We're going to give our marriage a tune-up.
No fishing.
That's the babysitter.
I'm Mrs.
Simpson.
Simpson? Simpson? Come back for more, eh? No! What--? Where are we supposed to get a sitter? If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go! What a kick in the teeth.
Why do you need a sitter? I'm 10 1/2! Mom! No.
-I'll give you a taste of me hand.
-No! -Grampa? -Hey! Who? What? -Could you do something? -I can dress myself.
Could you babysit the kids this weekend? -I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate.
-Sure.
Last resort.
Old Grampa, the feeb.
The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, nohow.
Everyone's against me.
I'll do it.
Just putting a few things in the trunk.
If Maggie gets sick, call here.
If she sticks her finger in a socket, here.
If she drinks cleanser-- -Give me the list! I can read.
-All right.
Goodbye.
And behave yourselves.
-Call this number if he falls.
-I heard that! Bye, Dad, Mom! Grampa, Mom forgot to give you this.
It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do.
You can smoke cigars? Mmm, bait! Better get some gas.
Fill her up.
I guess I'll go stretch my legs.
-Where to? -Catfish Lake.
-After General Sherman? -Who's General Sherman? The biggest catfish around.
Weighs over 500 pounds.
-Who says that? -They do.
Oh.
That's the only picture of him.
Can't see what he is.
He's freakishly big, though.
Gentlemen, I am going to catch General Sherman.
Oh, my! We'll go to the video store, grab a burger and head for the arcade.
Grampa's an old man who trusts us.
-Is it right to take advantage of him? -In these crazy times who knows what's right or wrong? My gut's telling me: Bleed Gramps dry.
Mr.
and Mrs.
Simpson.
Welcome.
Hello.
We're glad we could come.
-Hi, Helen.
-Hi.
Homer.
Here to give your marriage a little spit shine? None of your business.
Say, Reverend -are we gonna do any fishing? -Oh, I'm afraid not.
A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours.
It takes a weekend.
Bait our hooks with honesty.
That way a happy marriage -won't get away.
-I see.
I also understand bowling.
Our best turnout yet.
Why doesn't everyone introduce themselves and tell us why they're here? John? Gloria? My name's Gloria.
I'm here because Johnny hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time.
Not that I'd want his odor of sour defeat pressed against me.
-That's enough! -Thank you.
Why don't you tell us about why you're here? She keeps a filthy house and talks profanely.
-She's the Queen of the Harpies! -No, I'm not.
-Here's your crown, Your Majesty! -Get away from me! You've come to the right place.
First, look into each others' eyes.
Your eyes! I forgot how beautiful they are.
-Let's never fight.
-We were fools.
-Let's not talk about that.
-Let's not talk at all! Remember my saving your lives when we pass the collection plate.
All right.
Ned, Maude, what brings you here? -Well.
-Go on, Neddie.
Sometimes Maude underlines passages in my Bible -because she can't find hers.
-Lucky you don't keep guns.
-Homer, why are you here? -Oh.
-Because I looked down her dress.
-No, no.
Marge will tell us all your faults.
Tell us about hers.
-She's perfect.
-What are her faults? -It can be annoying.
-Homer.
-You'll get your turn.
-I'm done.
Okay.
Marge.
Well.
It's not that I don't love the guy.
I'm always sticking up for him.
-It's just that he's self-centered.
-Wait! Now, Homer.
He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays.
He chews with his mouth open, he gambles.
He hangs out at a seedy bar with lowlifes.
-It's true.
It's all true.
-Don't interrupt.
He blows his nose on towels and puts them back.
Only a couple of times.
Chocolate, chocolate brownie fudge.
-Chocolate-chocolate chip.
-Check.
-Did she really write that list? -What a question! -Next? -Syrup.
-Aisle six.
-All right.
But put out that cigar.
He drinks out of the carton.
He never changes the baby.
When he sleeps he makes chewing noises.
And when he wakes up he makes honking noises.
Oh, and he scratches himself with his keys.
I guess that's it.
Wait.
He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are long and yellow.
That's all I can think of.
You're all tired.
I want to thank you for letting me get it off my chest.
We missed the luau.
Let's call it a night.
But I can't avenge my partner's death with this peashooter.
That cannon of yours is against regulations! In this department we go by the book.
-Bye, book.
-All right! Kids, it's late.
You should go to bed.
We've had a big day.
Wise guy.
Little smart aleck.
I can't kid myself.
I'm having an ethical crisis.
Out at 5.
Catch Sherman at 5:30.
Clean him at 6.
Eat him by 6:30.
Back in bed by 7 with no incriminating evidence.
-The perfect crime.
-Homer? You're going fishing? I can't believe your selfishness.
You can go fishing anytime.
But we're here to save our marriage.
You're thinking about fishing while I'm talking.
-Can I be honest? -Yes.
You're right, I am! Help me, Marge.
-What do I do to be a good guy? -Get back in bed.
All right.
But I can't sleep.
Can I take a walk? Sure.
Gotta be a good husband.
Gotta be a good husband.
Gotta be a good husband.
Hey, kid! You forgot your-- Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big, ugly catfish.
I got a skillet and some butter with your name on it.
Homer? -Sugar? -Ten, please.
-Top me off.
-Does your ma let you drink coffee? For the last time, yes! Come on, give up! Big blowout at casa de Simpson.
The only adult is frail.
Bart's joint.
Two-ish.
Be there or be square.
Tell my friends? All right.
But I've got some funky friends.
I get out at noon, and I'm already invited to a party.
Now, this is a trust exercise.
You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you.
-Do I have to do this? -No.
I wouldn't recommend it.
As a trained marriage counselor this is the first time I've told a partner they were right.
It's all his fault.
I'm willing to put that on a certificate.
Okay.
You're probably wondering why I'm still here.
You'll make me the most famous fisherman ever.
Right up there with that the the bald guy in the cable fishing show.
Holy mackerel! Good to see you.
What's up? -Any chicks over 8? -Not yet, but the afternoon is young.
-What's wrong? -It's obvious.
We've set back the children's rights movement for decades.
You're really great.
Hey, you! You! Shut that door! Put that away! No! Stop! Oh! -You want me to take off my belt? -Yeah.
All right, I'll show you.
Doggone it! I love you! But I must kill you! Thanks for coming.
Nice tie, Nelson.
It's your dad's.
I tried to be a good babysitter, but I failed.
I'm a feeb.
A useless, old, worn out.
I have this unpleasant feeling I've never had before.
It's remorse, you burlesque of irrepressible youth.
-How do you make it go away? -Grab a brush and clean faster than you ever have before.
Hi, honey.
-How's the retreat? -I thought our marriage was in trouble.
But never this much trouble.
-How can--? -You don't know what this means.
This fish represents a better life for us.
It makes me a hero.
-To who? -Those weirdos in the store! -This fish shows how selfish you are! -Then I'll throw it back! -Oh, yeah, sure.
-Watch! Wow! I did it.
I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage.
I fought it for six hours.
One word and I toss it back.
You're telling me our marriage is in trouble? -Come here, baby! -Oh, Homer.
-We're back! -How's the marriage? Same as usual.
Perfectomundo.
The house looks wonderful! What's your secret? Pretending to cry.
That's right! You heard me! Pretending to cry! I can turn it on and off like a faucet.
"I'm crying.
I'm so sad.
" -Way to go, Grampa.
-I'll never trust another old person.
I fooled you! So long, suckers! Yep, General Sherman.
They say he's No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, he's 100.
-No one's caught him? -One came close.
His name was Homer.
Seven feet tall.
Arms like tree trunks.
Eyes like steel, cold and hard.
Had a shock of hair, red.
Like the fires of hell.

Hurry, Mom! All the good comics will be gone! Good comics? You only buy Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Equating friendliness with wimpiness will keep you from achieving popularity.
I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich.
-Hey, they do look alike.
-How did Richie die? Perhaps his materialism led him to take his life.
Kids, could you lighten up? Now Radioactive Man rules! He's always saying something cool.
-He's no wittier than others.
-Oh, yeah? Look.
He knocks a guy into the sun and says, "Hot enough for you?" I stand corrected.
We're here.
-Too bad we didn't dress up.
-This looks like a discount for Bartman! -Who are you dressed as? -I'm Bartman.
-Never heard of him, full price.
-Rip-off.
Is this on? Young people of Springfield welcome to our funny-book convention.
Thank you for pumping almost $300 into the local economy.
Your spirits have imparted a glow to this old warhorse.
I feel like Radiation Man! That's Radioactive Man, jerk! I stand corrected.
Have fun and be sure to clear out by 6 for the Shriners.
Get that punk's name.
No one makes a fool of me.
Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear? We've got a utility belt, tricorders, a light saber.
Sorry, kid.
-Hey, Bart-dude.
-Hey, Otto-man.
What's that? My own idea for a comic book.
It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic war zone! We're going to see Buddy Hodges.
The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV? I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam.
Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
Wish I was old enough to smoke Laramies.
Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're 16.
Look out! Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the Earth? You know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember Dirk Richter as Radioactive Man and not the sordid details of his final years.
So keep the questions tasteful.
Now, how about a big welcome for Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges! -Any questions? -When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum, how come his costume shrinks? Who knows? I did play Rum Tum Tugger in Cats.
Anybody see it? -Fallout Boy! -Yes, you, the masked boy.
Does Dirk Richter's ghost haunt the bordello where his body was found? Dirk Richter was a beautiful man.
Can't you vultures leave him alone? Hey, Radioactive Man Number 72! It's the imaginary tale where he marries Larva Girl.
Wow, Number 9! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
I'll show you something if you'll put your grubby little hands behind your back.
Behold.
Wow, Radioactive Man Number 1! I bet it's worth a million bucks.
It is, my lad.
But I'll let you have it for 100.
-All I got is 30.
-Then you can't have it.
But I must.
I never knew why God put me on this Earth.
Now, I know.
-To buy that comic book.
-Your emotion is out of place.
Did you kids have fun? Yeah.
For a dollar, a man sold me I never knew what Superman saw in her.
Give me Wonder Woman.
And that golden lariat.
She can tie me up any time.
-Homer! -Just kidding, Marge.
Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat! You really are a sport, Dad, taking us to a fine restaurant like that.
-What are you getting at? -I need $100 for a comic.
For a comic? Who drew it, Micha-malangelo? -Dad, I want this more than anything.
-Well, T.
S.
-Please, Dad.
-No.
No! Look, we all know that usually when you bug me I give in.
I'm not mad at you.
Shows you been paying attention.
But we all know I'm not giving you $100.
-Now, are you gonna stop bugging me? -No.
-Are you? Are you? Are you? -No.
No.
No.
-Okay! -I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Don't gloat, Homer.
When I was your age, I wanted a child-sized electric light bulb oven.
I didn't have the money.
So, I went to my sisters.
-We'll give you half our allowance.
-lf you'll be our slave.
-This gives us more free time.
-Let's take up smoking.
For months, I worked while my sisters smoked.
Venus Oh, Venus We want those dress shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Because I'd worked for it all those light bulb-warmed treats always tasted extra good.
Maybe a job is the answer.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
Maggie and Lisa are a handful-- -She means you should get a job.
-Me? Get a job? Were they serious? I didn't realize it, but a part of my childhood had slipped away, forever.
-What are you staring at? -Nothing.
At that moment, my dad and I were closer than we've ever-- -Bart! Stop it.
-Sorry.
I need some money A lot of money Empty bottles.
Well, it's practically empty.
Here you go, Apu.
Shall I apply this to the cost of a squishy? -No.
I need the dime.
-It is good you're learning a trade.
-Americanize this.
-Okay.
All those coins were worth three cents? Let the good times roll.
This is so humiliating.
I feel like such a geek.
-How's it going, Bart? -Terrible.
No one's buying.
Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more.
Let's see.
Now you look pathetic.
Lemonade sucks.
I need a new product.
Let's see.
Form a line.
Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear.
Hey, Bart, could you give me one on credit? -Beat it.
-You got a liquor license? -My dog ate it.
-Gotta have one to sell beer.
Writing tickets must make you thirsty.
Have a couple on the house.
-Seeing that it's a first offense.
-We can overlook this.
So long, officers.
Hey, what's all the--? My beer, my beer, my beautiful beer! The boy is desperate.
He wants money to buy a comic book.
A comic book? Boys never change.
-Which one? Nazi Smasher? -I don't think so.
Send him over to my house.
I've got a few chores he could do.
He can mix whitewash, right? -Mrs.
Glick? -You must be Bert Simpson.
Looks like you've got a strong young back.
Do you want something to eat? I've got dried apricots, almond paste, sauerkraut candy.
-No, thanks.
Who's that? -That's my brother, Asa.
He was killed in the Great War.
Held a grenade too long.
This one's for you Kaiser Bill, from the boys in D Company: Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob, and yeah, even Reggie.
He ain't so stuck-up once you get to-- Here, have some ribbon candy.
Boys love candy.
-No, thanks.
-Boys love candy! -I'd rather get to work.
-We'll start with yard work.
Then you can have a barley pop.
I want you to clear out all the weeds.
You do know which ones are weeds? -All of them? -Good boy.
Now be careful with these.
I'll be inside, watching my stories.
-Jack, please.
I'm married.
-That must be what's turning me on.
Stop it.
Some more.
Filthy, but genuinely arousing.
-Finished.
-Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! I'll get the iodine.
Iodine.
-Now don't fidget.
-Listen, lady, you don't have to-- They've never improved on iodine.
-Did you make any money? -No, but I'm in a lot of pain.
What you're doing for Mrs.
Glick is very nice.
-She doesn't have anybody.
-There's a reason.
The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it? I'll sludge you, you old bat.
Today, we wash Beulah.
Do you know what that is? Some old lady thing nobody's heard about for 50 years? It was my wedding dress.
But then, I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress.
Great story, lady.
Last night, I dreamed I held you in my arms.
No, not the iodine.
Burn the germs off with a torch.
Amputate my arm.
But not the-- Well, it's payday.
I'll wager you've been looking forward to this.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Here we are, two quarters.
-Two quarters? -You deserve every penny.
I've told my girlfriends about you and they have chores too.
-Two quarters! -Bart, you didn't say thank you.
I can leave without screaming or saying a bad word.
-But I'm not saying thank you.
-You're welcome.
All right, off you go to spend it on penny whistles and MoonPies.
-MoonPies, my butt.
-What's the problem, boy? I busted my hump all week and all I got was 50 cents.
When I was your age, -Really? -No.
I did everything I could and I've only got 35 bucks.
I'm done working.
Working's for chumps.
I'm proud of you.
I was twice your age before I figured that out.
-Can I have it for $40? -40 bucks? Forget it! It's all I've got.
I sold seeds.
I visited my aunt in the nursing home.
-I fished a dime out of the sewer! -No way.
What do you want? -Can I have it for 35.
-No! Kids.
I don't need this.
I've got a master's degree in folklore.
Do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973? Show me the 30 bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't getting up.
Martin, if you, Milhouse and I went in together we could buy a copy of Radioactive Man Number 1 right now! -Here you go.
-I don't want it.
We've got $100, and we'd like to buy Radioactive Man.
Why don't you just waddle over and get it? Yes, sir! Wow.
Breathe it in, boys.
-This is the stuff dreams are made of.
-It smells like my grandpa.
Looks like rain.
We better get this baby home.
Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
My pants, caught on barbed wire! Good Lord, choke, an A-bomb! Becoming radioactive.
From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man.
So, that's how it happened.
I'd have thought an atomic bomb would kill him.
-Now you know better.
-Turn the page, Bart.
Careful, careful.
You guys can come read it anytime.
-Why not keep it at my house? -That's crazy.
-It's ours as much as it's yours.
-How about this? Each one of us will get it for two days of the week.
Wait a minute, that still leaves one day.
Yeah, what about that? For that day, we'll use a random number generator.
I'll take 1 to 3, Milhouse will have 4 to 6 and Bart will take 7 to 9.
-Wait a minute, what about zero? -Yeah, what about zero? In the event of a zero possession will be determined by Rock, Scissor, Paper.
-Okay.
-Excellent.
Well, today being my Saturday, I guess I'll be taking my comic.
Nice try.
It almost worked, but tonight the comic book stays here.
-lf the comic book stays, then so do I.
-Me too.
Fine.
We'll all stay with the comic book.
It'll be like a sleepover.
That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like.
-I wanna read it again.
-Nice try.
Acids in your hand could damage it.
We want it to last forever so the last one alive can be buried with it.
-What do you mean, the last one alive? -I meant years from now! -Bart, don't push him.
-So you're both against me.
Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholomew J.
Simpson.
-Quit! -You quit! No, you quit! Would you boys like some milk and microwave s'mores? Thank you, Mrs.
Simpson.
Sweet dreams, boys.
-One more step and you're dead.
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-So do l, but I'm not getting up.
-Hey, what's going on? -Martin was trying to steal our comic.
-Let's tie him up! -Is this how you treat your guests? -Quiet.
-We'll take turns watching him.
-Okay, I'll go first.
So that's your little game.
Let Bart get nice and drowsy then, when his back's turned: Wham! You're crazy.
I'm telling your mom! -Tell him what we do with squealers.
-It's worse than when you have to pee? -You can't stop me! -The hell I can't.
Homer, it's really coming down.
Could you check on the boys? They're fine.
Bart, the comic! Don't let go of me, Bart! It's not that far to the ground.
The rains probably softened it up.
If you hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic.
Shut up! Shut up! Help me! I didn't even want the comic! I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big sideburns! Better come in the house.
You don't wanna get the sniffles.
Now, come on.
You can play your little tie-up game inside.
I've got some cocoa on the stove.
Who wants imitation marshmallows.
I'd raise my hand if I could.
It's no use, fellows.
Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came.
We worked so hard and now it's all gone.
We ended up with nothing because we can't share.
-What's your point? -Nothing.
It just ticks me off.
Well, the world is safe again.
But for how long?

Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests I'm pleased to dedicate this warning system.
In the off-chance of a nuclear disaster this sign will tell the good citizens of Springfield what to do.
Joke's on them.
If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign.
I'd like to present the man who made this sign possible by dropping his obstructionist legal challenges Montgomery Burns.
He's never late.
Something's wrong.
Nobody leaves "Diamond Joe" Quimby holding the bag! Must turn over.
Got to greet dignitaries.
-Oh, no! We've got to get a doctor! -Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me.
As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me.
He's suffering from what we call hypohemia.
It's a lack of blood.
Damn it, I know what it is! What can we do about it? -Our only hope is a transfusion.
-How long to sterilize a needle? -Seconds.
-Skip it.
Just leave me enough to get home.
It's not that simple.
His blood is double O-negative.
It's rare.
I'm B-positive.
Damn this gutter blood! Smithers, don't feel so bad.
After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot.
Attention, all employees.
Our boss and inspiration, Mr.
Burns is at death's door.
If you have double O-negative blood, please report to the bloodmobile.
That is all.
-I'd give, except for one thing.
-What? I don't wanna.
I can't believe you guys.
There's a wealthy human being who needs our help.
You don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy job.
-I'm your supervisor.
-Sorry, sir.
Maggie, look.
What's that? Lemur.
Lemur.
Zebu.
Zebu.
-What are you doing? -Teaching Maggie about nature.
She needs the advantages I didn't have.
Lisa, we did the best we could.
What's a zebu? An ox with a hump and a dewlap.
Hump and dewlap.
Hump and dewlap.
-What's my blood type? -A-positive.
Nuts! Rare blood and I don't have it.
You know his blood type? How romantic! A mother knows everything.
-My shoe size? -4-B.
-How many teeth do I have? -Sixteen.
-Ring? -Don't wear them.
But three.
-Allergies? -Butterscotch.
And? -Monster makeup.
-Impressive.
-How many hairs on my head? -Homie, you have lots of hair.
-Why do you need your blood type? -Burns may die.
He needs double O-negative blood.
No one has it.
-Bart does.
-Yes! All right! Congratulations! You've got a date with a needle! I don't have to give blood.
I have rights.
-Yeah, the right to remain silent.
-You must help those in need.
-It's the only decent thing to do.
-D'oh! It's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free.
That would be crazy! When you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches.
-You know "Hercules and the Lion"? -Is it a Bible story? Probably.
Once upon a time there was a big, mean lion who got a thorn in his paw.
Everyone tried to pull it out but nobody was strong enough.
They got Hercules.
And Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo! The moral is, the lion was so happy he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.
-How did a lion get rich? -It was the olden days! Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life or death here! -Just a sec! -Otto-man! You work here? All my friends are in school so I got a job as a bloodletting tech-dude! -Let's get this show on the road.
-Okay.
Let me wash up.
Homer.
Brave, young Bart.
-I don't know which one to hug first.
-The boy.
-We're ready with the transfusion.
-I'm not going to make it.
I want to dictate my epitaph.
-Go ahead.
-Charles Montgomery Burns: American and patriot.
American patriot.
Master of the atom scourge of the despot.
O, tyrant, hear his mighty name and quake! Smithers, I'm back! Top of the morning to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old you! Hi, Mr.
Burns.
Hey, there, Mr.
Brown Shoes.
How about that local sports team, huh? Mr.
Burns.
He's okay.
Jackpot! Well, that's game.
Hasta maÃ±ana, Osvaldo.
I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar! -Just remarkable, sir.
-You know, it's funny.
I tried every tincture, poultice, tonic and medicine there is.
And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy.
-What was the lad's name? -Bart Simpson.
-Who? -The son of Homer, a stiff in 7-G.
The Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail.
Very nice, indeed.
Bill.
Bill.
Summons.
Bill.
Wait a minute.
From C.
M.
Burns.
This is it.
Yes, this is it! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard! Dim the lights.
Turn them on.
Do something! Yes, Dad.
It's thin, but that's okay.
Could be a check.
There's no check, just a card.
Don't panic.
I'm sure it tells us what we'll get and where to pick it up.
Dear Bart, thank you kindly for the blood.
Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.
D'oh! It's just a card! Is that some way to show your gratitude? No gold, no diamonds.
No rubies, not even a lousy card! Wait, there was a card.
That's what got me so mad! You don't do these things to be rewarded.
You do it to help someone.
You're my wife and I love you very much but you're living in a world of make-believe.
With bells and magic frogs with funny hats.
-We got hosed.
-Bart! We got exactly what we wanted.
We gave an old man a second chance.
I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches.
And that man broke my promise! I've had it! Bart, take a letter! Dear Mr.
Burns I'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood.
And your card was just great.
In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic.
You stink! -Read that last part back to me.
-"You stink!" Good.
You are a senile, bucktoothed old mummy with bony girl arms and you smell like.
-An elephant's butt? -An elephant's butt.
-He's your boss.
You have to mail it? -Yep.
-Why don't you sleep on it? -Forget it.
Please, Homie.
For me.
Oh, all right.
You always do that hand thing.
And it usually works.
Cheap son of a.
Homer, breakfast is ready.
Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake.
I finally understand the meaning of.
-Of what? -Better half.
-Thank you.
-Where's the letter? Where is it? I don't think it is in the cornstarch canister.
It's somewhere.
It didn't just get up and walk away.
-Seen the letter? -Yep.
Think very carefully.
Where did you see it last? The last place I saw it -was in my hand -Yeah? as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
D'oh! Why did you do that? There were things that had to be said.
And I know you.
There was no guarantee you'd still be mad this morning.
I'll show you mad in the morning! Homer, you encouraged him.
You should be strangling yourself! She's right.
Don't panic.
They don't pick up the mail till noon.
There's still time! -Give it up.
It's locked up tight.
-Locked, eh? I might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr.
Lock.
Step aside, boy.
Hey! I'm with you, Homer.
Fight the power! -Why the hose? -Why do you think? I'll get it so the ink will run and no one can read it.
-But don't other people have mail? -So they won't get letters.
You know the letters people write.
"Dear somebody how is so-and-so? Blah, blah, blah.
Yours truly, Some Bozo.
" Big loss.
Look out for the mailman.
Give me a signal.
-Mailman's here.
-We'll use that.
No, I mean the mailman's here! God! Are you planning to water the mail? It wouldn't do any good to run because you know my name, right? -That's right.
-Well, I'm still gonna run! I want the whole world to hear the story of my struggle with hypohemia.
Roman is the finest ghostwriter.
He's written Like Hell I Can't.

The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahabaradad.
All right.
First question: Have you slept with anyone famous? Countess von Zeppelin and l-- What in blaze--? Listen to me, you bargain-basement Baudelaire! I'm not a starlet who can't string two words together.
I can write this thing myself! You're fired! Hello.
My name is Mr.
Burns.
-I believe you have a letter for me.
-What's your first name? I don't know.
Great plan, Bart.
Oh, look, Maggie! What is that? Dodecahedron! Dodecahedron! I don't know what you're doing but your father's trying to worry.
"Chapter the Fifth.
" The trip to the infirmary with most unexpected results.
Twenty-eight minutes till Burns comes.
Time for Operation Mail-Take.
Can I help you? Don't be frightened.
It's a letter opener.
Who are you? Give a fake name.
Homer Simpson.
Simpson, eh? Simpson! Why, there's a letter from you.
I'll read it right now.
"Mr.
Burns, I'm glad you enjoyed my son's blood.
And your card was just great.
" Why, Simpson! You've made my day.
You're a true gentleman.
-Well, I'll be on my way.
-Hello, there's more.
"In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic.
" You stink! You're a senile, bucktoothed mummy "with bony girl arms.
And you smell like an elephant's butt!" Come on, Joey.
You have to twist my arm? I don't tell you how to do your job, okay? I could crush him like an ant.
But it would be easy.
No, revenge is a dish best served cold.
I'll bide my time until.
What the hell, I'll just crush him.
Senile, eh? Bucktoothed, am I? Bony arms, are they? Liver spots, did I? -Shameless, will you? -His pink slip for you to sign.
Now that's odd.
I've just robbed a man of his livelihood and yet I feel empty.
Tell you what, have him beaten to a pulp! -But-- -What?! Nothing, sir.
I've never seen him this mad, and he's always kind of mad.
-Me and my big letter-writing pen.
-What's done is done.
No matter what, we'll pull through.
You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids and I'll die in a gutter.
It's practical and within our means.
They said I'd destroy the family.
I never believed it.
Nobody believed it.
We were just trying to scare you.
-You know Homer Simpson? -Yeah, nice guy.
Play poker with him.
-Beat him up.
-You got it.
-Wait.
-What is it? -Nothing.
Wait.
-What? Beat, but -don't kick.
-Got it.
-Wait.
-What? -What did Homie do anyway? -He saved Mr.
Burns' life.
In closing, I'd like to thank you.
"What's that?" you say.
"Me, thanking you?" No, it's not a misprint.
I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it.
The End.
-Smithers.
How'd the beating go? -Sir-- There was no beating.
-That's a hell of a thing! Why? -Because l-- -I called it off.
-Judas! I'm sorry.
But I just couldn't hurt Homer.
-He saved you.
-I see.
I know you're mad.
I'm gonna stand outside until you forgive me.
No need, Smithers.
You've been the sober ying to my raging yang.
Put her there, old pal.
I wish this handshake would never end, but we still have -the Simpson matter to attend to.
-We do indeed, old friend.
We do.
-Moe's Tavern.
-Is Mike there? Last name, Rotch.
Hold on, I'll check.
Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch! Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch lately? One of these days, I'm gonna catch you and carve my name on your back with an ice pick.
What's up? You're not your normal self.
I got my problems.
Give me another one.
Don't drink to forget your problems.
Yeah.
You should only drink to enhance your social skills.
We'll get the Simpsons an extravagant present.
An unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present! Too practical.
Too cutesy.
Too cornball.
A pool table? I'm not going to turn his home into a saloon.
-Eureka! We've found it! -But, sir, it's $32,000! Don't you dare sully this moment with your price-taggery.
It's perfect.
Oh, woe is me.
Oh, my! It's Mr.
Burns.
Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Wait, Dad, he's smiling.
-You brought us a present! -What did you think I was gonna do? Have you beaten to a bloody pulp? To show there's no hard feelings, here's a copy of my book: Will There Ever Be a Rainbow? I haven't forgotten you.
Here.
-Wow! A crowbar! -It's to open the crate, stupid.
What did I tell you? I bet it's filled with rubies, sapphire, pearls.
-Wow! A big, ugly head! -D'oh! Actually, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head.
It was carved by Mesoamerican Indians 3000 years ago.
This gruesome customer is Xtapolapocetl, the god of war.
Awesome! No, Maggie, not Aztec.
Olmec.
Olmec.
-What does it do? -Nothing.
-Really, what does it do? -Whatever it does, it's doing it now.
I'll let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xtapolapocetl.
Ta.
-Did you see their faces? -You're my god of generosity.
Save a guy's life and what do you get? Nothing.
Worse than nothing.
Just a big, scary rock.
-Don't badmouth the head.
-It's the thought that counts.
The moral is, a good deed is its own reward.
-We got a reward.
The head is cool.
-Well, then.
I guess the moral is, no good deed goes unrewarded.
Wait a minute.
If I hadn't written that letter -we would've gotten nothing.
-Well.
The moral is, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
-Perhaps there is no moral.
-Exactly! Just stuff that happened.
-But it was a memorable few days.
-Amen to that!

## The Simpsons ## D'oh! Bart.
Bart! Hey, Bart.
Lisa! It's 6:00 a.
m.
Something's wrong.
Dad died.
No, no, he's fine.
What do you know? I'm relieved.
My birthday's in two days.
I'll be eight years old.
It's a big number-- almost double digits.
Enjoy it while you can.
Everything changes when you hit the big 1 -0.
Your legs go.
Candy doesn't taste as good.
Let me pour my little heart out.
Sorry.
This old-timer does ramble on sometimes.
I do so much for you and you have disappointed me - on all my birthdays.
- Okay.
I've made things for you-- Okay, okay, okay! It's done.
Birthday gift coming your way! Oh, thank you.
Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry.
Can do.
Hmm, Krusty Hotline.
Hi, kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline.
If you haven't asked your parents' permission-- naughty, naughty but Krusty forgives you.
Two dollars for the first minute for each additional minute.
Thanks for calling, kids.
A new message every day.
Maggie! Bart, I asked you to watch your sister.
I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me.
Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?! I washed it.
Thank you, Marge.
Ahh! Pink?! I can't wear pink to work.
Everybody wears white.
I'm not popular enough to be different.
You have plenty of white shirts.
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Oh, no! Pink! Pink! Pink! It's all over, Marge! It's all over! I don't know how this happened.
Ah, my lucky red hat.
Clean as a whistle.
You did this to me! I apologize.
No one will notice if you wear a pink shirt to work.
Wait a minute.
Go back.
Zoom in.
Why is that man in pink?! That's Homer Simpson-- a boob from Sector 7-G.
Judging by his outlandish attire he's some sort of freethinking anarchist.
I'll call security, sir.
Excellent.
Yes, these color monitors have already paid for themselves.
Pink! I don't get his statement.
Shh, shh, shh.
Coming.
Hey, Homer we saved you a doughnut.
It has pink frosting.
Thanks.
It looks-- Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing pink doesn't mean I'm some kind of pink doughnut-eater although it is tempting.
Drop that doughnut.
Let's go, pinky.
You don't understand.
My son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry.
Spare me the tiresome antics of the Simpson family.
Take him away.
His body cavity search revealed nothing.
We must have X-rayed him a hundred times.
Maybe he's telling the truth.
Or you're in cahoots.
I recall you had a penchant for bell-bottomed trousers back in '7 9.
That was my costume for the plant production of H.

'''Meditations on Turning Eight' by Lisa Simpson.
I had a cat named Snowball.

She lied, she lied! Why, oh, why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy--'' No deal.
Dad, you should do this.
It's no different than the time I let you vote for me.

''Dog on Fire!'' ''Dog on Fire!'' Do you hear voices? I'm hearing one now, though I'm trying to watch TV.
Yes.
Are you quick to anger? Bart, shut up or I'll shut you up! Yes.
Do you wet your pants? Even the best of us has an occasional accident.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
So did I pass? No.
Bart! Careful, men.
He wets his pants.
Uhh the devil with his fly open.
Right.
A spill on the floor with bugs going after it.
Good.
The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? We have a very simple method.
Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane.
Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's the little black guy.
Who are you? I'm MichaelJackson from theJacksons.
I'm Homer Simpson from the Simpsons.
I can't believe you never heard of me.
I'm a very popular entertainer.
Of course, I've heard of you.
You'd have to be living under a rock-- What's your name? MichaelJackson.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Heard of MTV or Motown? No.
''Beat It''? You beat it.
''Thriller''? What was that? - ''Thriller.
'' - No.
How about this? BillyJean is not my lover She's just a girl who says that I am the one But the kid is not my son Hee-hee-hee Wow! How do your feet do that? The moonwalk? No, your feet! Raise your heel a bit.
Put a little pressure on the ball of your foot.
Uh-huh.
Huh? D'oh! You seem like a nice guy.
Why are you here? I wore a pink shirt.
I understand.
People thought I dressed crazy.
What did you wear? One white glove covered with rhinestones.

Hey, Michael, I don't get it.
These guys seem as normal as you and me.
Homer, this is Floyd.
He's an idiot savant.
He can multiply any two numbers in his head just like that.
Five times nine.
Forty-five.
Wow! This guy is the chief.
He's been here since 1 968.
Never says a word.
Hey, Chief.
Hello.
It's about time somebody reach out to me.
Gee, I got to call my family.
This is embarrassing calling from a nuthouse.
They think I'm a god.
I could call for you.
Oh, great.
Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight.
Joe's Crematorium.
You kill 'em, we grill 'em.
Hello.
Who is this? Bart Simpson.
Who are you? I'm MichaelJackson.
The MichaelJackson? No way.
I'm with your father in a mental institution.
Is Elvis with you? He could be.
It's a big hospital.
If you're really MichaelJackson who were your last four Grammy dates? Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles.
Shiver me timbers! You are MichaelJackson! Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives? I'm afraid not.
Your father needs your help.
You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you? Hmm lobotomy.
That's all right, son.
There's probably a downside I don't see.
Uh-huh.
New Bedlam Asylum.
Loves us.
Needs us.
Fears he may never see us again.
MichaelJackson, whoo-hoo! I love you, man.
Hey, Mom Dad's in a mental institution.
Oh, my God.
Mother was right.
Don't you worry.
Your family will be here soon.
The only way out ain't pretty.
What's that? Dating a nurse.
I knew you'd send your father to the crazy house.
You said poorhouse.
I said crazy house! Poorhouse.
Crazy house! Poorhouse.
Crazy house! Hello, you've reached the New Bedlam Wrongly-Committed Hotline.
All our operators are currently busy.
Please stay on the line.
What's wrong, Homer? This place is so strange.
Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy but I'm scared.
We all get scared sometimes.
Maybe I can help you.

I was working at an insurance company.

The job was my life.
Then one Monday morning, I couldn't leave the house.
Was the door locked? I just couldn't face what was out there.
Was it raining? No, Homer Dave suffers from agoraphobia-- a fear of open areas and crowds.
Dave, go on.
I knew I just couldn't make that long drive to work.
Were you out of gas? Baby.
Your husband suffers from a persecution complex extreme paranoia and bladder hostility.
If you talk to him without mentioning Bart you'd see how sane he is.
You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord! Mmm, pancakes.
Oh, Mr.
Simpson, you've got a visitor.
D'oh! Marge! Oh, Homie! After talking to your wife we believe you're no threat to yourself or others.
That's the most flattering thing anyone ever said to me.
Could I have it in writing? ''Not insane.
'' Hmm.
I'm proud of you, Homer.
Michael, you really helped me get through this.
If you ever find your marbles, come visit us.
How about today? I'm here voluntarily.
You are? Why? In 1 97 9, I got real depressed when my Off the Wall album just got one lousy Grammy nomination.
Joe's Taxidermy.
You snuff'em, we stuff'em.
Boy, when I get home I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck and smother you with kisses.
Whatever they got you on, cut the dose.
I'm bringing MichaelJackson home for a few days.
Isn't that cute? He's heard of you.
Make sure we have cold cuts, and put some beer on ice-- I'm a vegetarian, and I don't drink.
Are you sure you're here voluntarily? Yes.
Please make sure he doesn't tell anybody I'm coming.
Yes, Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul-- No, not even Milhouse.
Huh? Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret? No.
MichaelJackson is coming to my house! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! Aunt Bella?! Wait a minute.
I got a call on the other line.
MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! MichaelJackson?! We've just been handed a bulletin from our Rock 'n' Rumor department.
MichaelJackson is moonwalking his way to Springfield.
While we check it out why don't you enjoy a seldom-heard extra-long version of''In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.
'' MichaelJackson! Such a thing happens once in a blue moon.
Do I dare leave my post? Ay, caramba! Uh, this is the most exciting thing to happen to our fair town since the Dalai Lama visited in 1 952 and so, I hereby declare that Route 401 currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway will henceforth be known as the MichaelJackson Expressway.
I think I can see him.
Oh, here he comes.
Oh! The guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who was just released from a mental hospital.
Thanks, everybody.
It's great to be sane.
We want Michael! We want Michael! We want Michael! Here he is.
Here's the guy you want to see! Aahh! Huh? Huh? He's 300 pounds.
He's white.
He's dressed without flair.
What made me think MichaelJackson would even visit this jerkwater burg? You owe us MichaelJackson.
Don't ever show your face around here again, you tool.
Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood and before I join them, I have one question.
Today is my birthday.
You promised you'd get me something and and I'm afraid to ask.
Maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask.
I thought so.
Oh, Bart, you-- Come off!.
I'm sane now.
Dear Bart I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only.
Perhaps, if a professional so advises I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion but rest assured, it will be purely for show.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Hey, Bart.
Hey, you.
When I was a kid, I didn't have much money.
You know what I did when my sisters' birthdays rolled around? Stiffed them? No.
I wrote them a song to show that I cared.
I can't write a song.
I'm only ten.
When I was your age I had six gold records.
Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what MichaelJackson looks like.
You look like a big, fat mental patient.
I often hear that.
Just leave me alone.
Either MichaelJackson is working in a recording studio in L.
A or he's here with you willing to work on this song.
It's your choice.
So long.
Wait, wait, Michael! Go sit at the piano, and I'll boil some coffee.
## [ Singing To Theme From Bridge on the River Kwai .]
Uh, no.
Bart, we've got to get to your real feelings about your sister.
I don't have any.
Let's go look at her.
Maybe that will help.
Oh, she looks sad.
That's 'cause she knows you're looking at her.
Although I know you're looking at me, I would look exactly the same, even if you weren't.
Bart, think.
What happens to you when you turn eight? Well, your training wheels come off your bike.
Good.
That's good.
You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
- Lisa.
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

- Lisa.
What, Bart? It's 6:00 a.
m.
That's right.
Hope you like your present.
And a-one and a-two and a-one, two, three, four.
Yeah! Oh, this is the best present I ever got! Thank you, Bart.
Thank you, Michael.
My work is done here.
What happened to your voice? This is my real voice.
I'm Leon Compowski.
I'm a bricklayer from New Jersey.
All my life I was angry, until one day I talked like this.
All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me.
So, I kept on doing it.
To make a tired point, which one of us is truly crazy? Not me.
I got this.
Bye-bye, Leon.
You're a credit to dementia.

How dumb do they think I am? Huh? A check? One million dollars.
I'm rich! Mr.
Simpson, I can assure you, this check of yours is nonnegotiable.
Oh, yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure? See where it says ''Void, void, void'' and ''This is not a check''? ''Cash value - '' Mr.
Banker, do not honor.
'' - Shut up.
I had a feeling it was too good to be true.
Every time you get a million dollars, something queers the deal.
I don't think real checks have exclamation points.
Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest.
Marge, I never read a magazine in my life, and I'm not gonna start now.
Hey, a cartoon! Ain't it the truth? No, it's not the truth, Homer.
It's well-documented that women are safer drivers than men.
Oh, Marge, cartoons don't have any deep meaning.
They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.
Hey, Einstein, put down your reading.
- It's lunchtime.
- You go ahead.
Hey, you don't wanna eat? What you do, get one of them stomach staples? As Tolstoy said in Quotable Notables ''Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread.
'' - Who is that bookworm, Smithers? - Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh? How very strange.
His job description clearly specifies an illiterate.
We now return to Troy McClure and Delores Montenegro in Preacher With a Shovel.
But Irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear.
Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box.
God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.
You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
It's not just one magazine, Marge.
They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket.
God! Those kids don't know what they're missing.
- Dad! - Hey, what gives, man? We're all going to sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
''Then I heard the sound ''that all arctic explorers dread-- the pitiless bark of the sea lion.
'' He'll be killed! Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.
Don't be so-- Oh, you're right.
Homey, put down your magazine for a minute.
- Huh? - I thought you might wanna snuggle.
That reminds me.
''Seven ways to spice up your marriage.
'' Marge, ''You have a nice body and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask.
'' Thank you, Homey.
- Wow! Little meat loaf men! Where did you get the idea for this, Mom? Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong, and it was free! - Free.
- It certainly has enriched our lives.
Wow.

'' Sounds interesting.
Bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do too.
Mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on.
What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say, uh ''Think of a better opening.
'' - How's it going, honey? - Not very well.
Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride.
- Do kids go on bike rides anymore? - Yes! I don't know.
I thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore.
- Do kids still use that word ''cool''? - Yes, Mom! Okay, America, inspire me.
Wow, a bald eagle.
Hmm.
Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad.
Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine.
''So burn the flag if you must, but before you do ''you better burn a few other things.
''You better burn your shirt and your pants.
'' Be sure to burn your TV and car.
''Oh, yes, and don't forget to burn your house ''because none of those things could exist without six white stripes seven red stripes and a hell of a lot of stars.

''Who would have thought such mighty oaks or such a powerful nation could grow out of something so fragile, so pure?'' - Thank you.
- What do you think? - It's good.
A little too good for an eight-year-old.
Me thinks I detect the sickly scent of the daddy.
Mr.
Simpson, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daughter's essay.
- Lisa, will you excuse us? - Okay.
''We the purple''? What the hell was that? - Are you a professional writer? - Mm-mmm.
Are you interested in politics or government? I don't know.
- Are you interested in anything? - I don't know.
- Could you touch your nose for me? Hmm.
- Mm.
Hmm.
Lisa, after meeting your father I've decided to award you an additional five points.
Congratulations.
You and your family are going to Washington.
Wa-hoo! Who would have guessed reading and writing would pay off? - Yes, sir, can I get you something? - Playing cards, notepad aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin propeller-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask - and anything else I've got coming to me.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Hmm.
- Steward! Little boy, I bet you'd like to visit the cockpit.
Ooh-ooh, baby! And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle.
Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats? No, thank you.
I'd rather push this button.
Oops! - No! - We're all gonna die! Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do.
Taxi.
! Oh, look, Homer, the I.

- Boo! - Oh, boo yourself.

Here we are, kids.
The Watergate.
- Hey! Homer, look.
! They give you a shower cap and body gel and bathrobes.
And a welcoming mint on your pillow.
Wow, a shoehorn.
Just like in the movies.
Shoe goes on, shoe goes off, shoe goes on, shoe goes off.
Shoe goes on, shoe goes off.
Hey, I call first bedsies.
Bart, there's no such thing as first bedsies.
You just made that up.
Well, okay, which one do you want? I want that one.
Really? You want that one? It's all yours.
Whatever you say.
- Why? What's wrong with it? - Nothing.
- Have a good night's sleep, Lisa.
- No, really, what? - Nothing.
- What did you do to it? - Nothing.
- Mom! What the-- D'oh! Stupid welcoming mint! - Hello? - Good morning.
This is your wake-up call.
Wake-up call? It's 2:00 a.
m.
Sorry, fatso.
Free food? Lisa, I'm Faith Crowley-- patriotism editor of Reading Digest.
Oh, I love your magazine.
My favorite section is '' How to Increase Your Word Power.
'' That thing is really, really, really good.
Well, good.
Lisa, I'd like you to meet some other finalists.
- This is Trong Van Dinh and Maria Dominguez.
- Hello.
Maria is the National Spelling Bee Champion.
And Trong has won both the Westinghouse Talent Search and the NFL Punt, Pass and Kick Competition.
Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability? - Hmm? - Sure, I guess.
- Oh, me too! These are special V.
I.
P.
badges.
They'll get you into places other tourists never see.
- Miss, what does the ''I'' stand for? - Important.
- Oh! How about the ''V''? - Very.
- Oh! And, miss, just one more question.
- Person.
Ah! - What does the ''I'' stand for again? - Oh! - ''On this spot, Richard Nixon bowled back-to-back 300 games.
'' - Yeah, right.
Wow, the president's bathroom.
- Do you mind? - Barbara Bush! Oh, you have those damn badges.
Okay.
This tub was installed in 1 894.
Mmm.
Money.
Hey, watch it, chief.
Folks, we print more than Oh, and in case you were wondering no, we don't give out free samples.
Lousy, cheap country.
Bart, get out of The Spirit of St.
Louis.
! - Hey, what's so funny.
- Oh, Marge, grow up! Congressman, this is, uh, Springfield National Forest.
- Now, basically, what we wanna do is cut her down.
- Uh-huh.
As you can see in our artist's rendition, it's full of old growth just aging and festering away.
In comes our logging company to thin out the clutter.
It's all part of nature's, you know, cycle.
Well,Jerry, you're a whale of a lobbyist, and, uh I'd like to give you a logging permit, I would, but, uh this isn't like burying toxic waste.
People are gonna notice those trees are gone.
Eh, Congressman, this is where it gets awkward.
I-- I never quite know how to put this.
- I just want to-- - Offer me a bribe? - Oh, what is it? It's that little girl from Springfield who wrote the essay.
- Could be a good photo-op.
- Sure, fine.
- So, uh, where do we-- - Duh, duh, duh, Not here.
I've got a little place that I use for these, uh, matters.
Call me tonight.
- Well, hi there.
You must be Lisa Simpson.
- Hello, sir.
Lisa, you're a doer, and who knows, maybe someday you'll be a congressman or a senator.
We have quite a few women senators, you know.
- Only two.
I checked.
You're a sharp one.
Well, how about a few pictures? Tot shot always plays in the sticks.
Oh, isn't that nice? Now there is a politician who cares.
If I ever vote, it'll be for him.
Mom? Lisa, the contest isn't for three hours.
I'm too excited to sleep.
Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial? - Who's that? - An early crusader for women's rights.
She led the Floor Mop Rebellion of 1 91 0.
Later, she appeared on the highly unpopular - Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Oh! ''I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws.
'' - Amen, sister.
I told you no one ever came here.
So, Bob, where do we stand on Springfield Forest? Do I get my logging permit? Well, let me put it this way,Jerry.
Timber! - What a pooch.
- Woof woof!.
How can I read my essay now? I don't believe my own words.
Honest Abe-- he'll show me the way.
- Mr.
Lincoln-- - Mr.
Lincoln, I need your advice.
What can I do to make this a better country? Is this a good time to buy a house? - I can't get my boy to brush.
- Would I look good with a mustache? I tried using turpentine, but that just made it worse.
Mr.
Lincoln? Mr.
Lincoln? My name is Lisa Simpson, and I have a problem! Mr.
Jefferson, my name is Lisa Simpson - and I have a problem.
- I know your problem.
The Lincoln Memorial was too crowded.
- Sorry, sir.
It's just-- - No one ever comes to see me.
I don't blame them.
I never did anything important-- just the Declaration of Independence the Louisiana Purchase, the dumbwaiter-- Maybe I should be going.
I caught you at a bad time.
Wait! Please don't go.
I get so lonely.
The truth must be told.
Oh.
! Oh.
! Oh.
! Oh.
! Rudy, my man, you're a miracle worker.
Your laundry, sir.
There you go.
Buy yourself something nice.
- Thank you.
- Bart, are you ready to go to-- - I'll room service you.
! - Before you kill me remember, this trip is all expenses paid.
- Thank you.
- Oh, this guy is awful.
I know, honey, but just sit still.
- Welcome, everyone, to the awards luncheon.
I'd like to introduce our distinguished judges who will select our scholarship winner.
Former Redskins great Alonzo Flowers perennial third-party candidate Wilson DeFarge Senate page Brad Fletcher skin care consultant Rowena and wealthy gadabout Chilton Gaines.
Our first essayist will be Lisa Simpson.
Lisa? Lisa? - Oh, there she is.
Lisa Simpson will now read her essay-- I would like to read a different essay, if I may? Um-- Okay.
The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago and very little has changed.
It stank then and it stinks now.
Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air.
- Cool! A ruckus.
And who did I see taking a bribe but the honorable Bob Arnold.
- But don't worry, Congressman I'm sure you can buy all the votes you need with your dirty money.
And this will be one nation under the dollar with liberty and justice for none.
Senator, there's a problem at the essay contest.
- Please, son, I'm very busy.
- A little girl - is losing faith in democracy.
- Good Lord! Congressman, we want to drill for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head.
Well-- Teddy who? - Congressman you're under arrest.
- You work fast.
- I work for Uncle Sam.
We will now vote on the House bill 1 022-- the expulsion of Bob Arnold.
Mr.
Speaker, I'm all for the bill, but shouldn't we tack on - a pay raise for ourselves? - No.
! Okay, this should make my bosses very happy.
- Your bosses? - Yep.
All 250 million of them.
When my family arrived in this country four months ago we spoke no English and had no money in our pockets.
Today, we own a nationwide chain of wheel-balancing centers.
Where else but in America-- or possibly Canada-- could our family find such opportunity? That's why whenever I see the stars and stripes I'll always be reminded of that wonderful word ''flag.
'' There will be a brief recess while the judges tabulate their votes.
Lisa, what's gotten into you? Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasing.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't think of a nice way to say America stinks.
Extra! Extra! Feds nab rotten rep.
Give me one of those.
''Imprisoned congressman becomes born-again Christian.
'' I can't believe it.
The system works.
- He already sang this song.
- No, that was about the budget gap.
- This is the trading gap.
And now the moment of truth.
Will the winning essay be '' Bubble on, O melting pot''? ''Lift high your lamp, Green Lady''? ''USA, A-OK''? Or ''Cesspool on the Potomac''? Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool! And now the winner is '' USA, A-OK,'' by Trong Van Dinh.
D'oh! Miss Crowley, thank you for this oversized novelty check.
I would like share this honor with all of my fellow essayists particularly the courageous Lisa Simpson whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
- Give her the check! I was serious.
- Ow.
! - Bart! Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in.
Shh!

##Ahh, The Simpsons ## D'oh! Homer, you silly goose.
The weed-whacker's just for the edges.
You'll be out here all day.
I'm almost done.
You are a picture and a half.
If you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and we'll put the heat to the meat.
Nummy-nummy-num! I'll be there! Notty-notty-not.
''The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Nedibles! Maudacious vittles!'' I think it means he's having a barbecue.
Why doesn't he just say so?! He's trying to be friendly.
If you gave Ned Flanders a chance-- I don't care if he is the nicest guy in the world.
He's a jerk.
End of story.
We can't hold it against him just because he has things better than we do.
Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge.
You put me in my place.
Oh, Homer It's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of person you are Marge Simpson, president of the ''We Love Flanders'' fan club.
Fee, fi, fo, fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin of Marge Simpson.
Mm-mm-mm-mmm! Hi, Ned.
Um Homer sends his apologies but, um there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of.
We now return to the Canadian Football League draft.
And so, the Rough Riders who scored only four rouges all last season,Jack Stupid Flanders.
Go ahead, Marge.
Have a ball.
What if they came back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out.
''We should have never gone to the Flanders'.
''Why did we go to the Flanders' and leave Homer alone with no food?'' And I'd be laughing-- Laughing from my grave.
Heh, heh, heh.
What is it, boy? What? Mmm.
Barbecue.
Ahh.
Mmm.
Hey, I'm back.
Nice seeing you.
Hey! Oh! Hey, hey, Homer! Ahmmffluhff Inside.
Okay.
Thanks for coming.
You're it.
Electricity.
Nuh-uh! No electricity.
Only in freeze tag.
Okay.
Now you're it! Hey! No tag-backs! Yeah, you cheater.
You lie like a fly with a booger in its eye.
The fly was funny.
The booger was the icing on the cake.
Friends, we love you all but I also have a sinister motive for asking you all here ''sinister'' being Latin for left-handed.
But enough joking.
That was a joke? Friday, I'm saying toodle-loo to the pharmaceutical game.
- What's he talking about? - Leaving? No, I kid you not.
Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years.
What are you going to do? Like one out of every nine Americans I'm left-handed, and let me tell you it ain't all peaches and cream.
Your writing gets smeared.
Lord help you if you drive a standard transmission.
I'm opening up a one-stop store for southpaws.
Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed scissors.
Going to call it ''The Leftorium.
'' So, Homer, I'm dying to know what do you think ofThe Leftorium? It sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
I know it's a little risky and it's going to be a lot of hard work but it's going to be a lot of fun too.
Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz? Oh, no.
The Springfield Mall.
Here, you two, make a wish.
Nah! - It's fun.
- No, it isn't.
You must have something you want to wish for.
Hmm, let's see Nah.
Hmm Hey! I've got an ambition to do some wishin'.
Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can! Ooh! Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Eh too far.
Hmm Okay, ready.
Yes! Oh, yes! Read it and weep! In your face! I've got more chicken bone! What did you wish for? No! Don't say.
Otherwise, it won't come true.
Ooh, that would be a shame.
Wouldn't it, Flanders? Mmm.
Dum-da-dah D'oh! Bart how many hours a day do you watch TV? Six.
Seven if there's something good on.
Don't you think you should get a little fresh air? Yeah, but what are you going to do? TV gives so much and asks so little.
It's a boy's best friend.
That's the problem.
Even as we speak millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise.
Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves.
Hello, I am Akira.
Huahh!! That didn't hurt very much because I know the ancient art of karate.
Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence.
People from all walks of life: - doctors -Hi-yaah!! - homemakers - Hu-yaah!! - landscape architects - Huhh-yah!! - choreographers - Haww.
High karate at low, low prices.
I cannot tell a lie.
This is a great deal.
Hohh! Hey, Mom, how about if I learn karate? Will that make you happy? That sounds fine.
See, you knock TV, and then it helps you out.
I think you owe somebody a little apology.
Well, if it isn't The Leftorium.
Hey, Flanders, how's business? Oh, a little pokey but things are going to pick up.
Oh! I am so sorry.
How much do I owe you? Now that was an accident.
Really? Well, thanks.
Could you validate my parking? Absitively posolutely.
So, Flanders, have you sold anything? Not yet, but one of the mall security guards took a long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
Greetings, I am Akira your guide on the path to true karate.
And this is our map, The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
It will teach us our most important lesson.
We learn karate, so we need never use it.
Um I already know how not to hit a guy.
Can we break out the nunchukus? Yes, the impetuousness of youth.
For now, let us read.
When do we break blocks of ice with our heads? First you must fill your head with wisdom.
Yo, Sensei, can I go to the bathroom? You can if you believe you can.
Pay money to read books.
The hell with this.
Come on.
Touch of Death! Touch of Death! Hah, hah, hah! I'm telling you.
Flanders' store was dee-serted.
What do you think of your bestest buddy now? Dad, do you know what ''schadenfreude'' is? No, I do not know what ''schadenfreude'' is.
Please tell me because I'm dying to know.
It's German for ''shameful joy--'' taking pleasure in others' suffering.
I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt.
He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel-- What's the opposite of that ''shameful joy'' thing of yours? Sour grapes.
Those Germans have a word for everything.
What did you learn in karate school? Yeah, this better be worth my ten bucks.
Uh I learned the Touch of Death.
Ooh, the Touch of Death.
Permit me to demonstrate.
Lisa, shut your eyes.
Soon you will be at peace.
Hey, quit it, Bart.
Quit it.
Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Mom!! Don't use the Touch of Death on your sister.
Uh-oh! Got to get back to karate class.
Missed a spot.
Dopey kid.
Coming through.
Step aside, lady.
Mmm, baby.
How was class? We learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
That will learn them.
What did you swipe? An ''I Love Lefty'' glass.
Left-handed pinking shears.
Pinking shears? Let's go to the food court and steal some baked potatoes.
Hey, Flanders, when are your busy hours? I expect things to pick up soon.
I think word of mouth is starting to spread.
I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase.
Oh, right as rain.
Or as we say around here, ''left as rain.
'' Just stamp it.
Okay.
Hey, Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing? Lousy.
He just sits there all day.
He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Crummy right-handed corkscrews.
What does he sell? Uh well, actually, Moe, uh I don't know.
Lise, change the channel.
You change it.
Ooowaaah Okay, okay.
I grow weary of this new channel.
Change it back.
But, Bart Eeeyaahhh Apple apple apple Come on, candy bar.
Hey, you're that first apple I didn't want.
That sinks it.
I'm really going to let them have it this time.
Simpson, put that box on Mr.
Burns' desk.
Chop-chop! Oh, look, Smithers.
Another member of our nuclear family with some helpful suggestions.
And what's your name? Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh? Mm-hmm.
I'm Monty Burns.
''Keep that handsome owner out of sight.
He's distracting the female employees.
'' Smithers? Got me, sir.
Oh, it's a real one.
''No more apples in the vending machine, please.
'' Well, that's almost a sentence.
Can I leave? Of course, and don't worry.
There will be plenty of apples for you.
Nobody will take away your precious apples.
The note was asking you to-- No, tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple.
She'll make everything all right.
I promise.
Damned infernal gizmo.
My kingdom for a left-handed can opener! Uh, Mr.
Burns Come on, Homer.
Tell him about the store.
I'm dying out here.
Sorry, Flanders.
Huh? Are you sure you're not interested? $200 is only the asking price.
Sorry, Ned.
Hey, I'm flexible.
You don't have to pay all at once.
I'll be here all night if you change your mind.
Hey, Flanders, is everything okay? Oh, yeah, sure.
See anything you like? Oh, it's not good enough for you but it's good enough for me? I wouldn't be caught dead buying this Hello.
Got your eye on the gas grill, huh? She's a butane beaut.
I'll give you 20.
Homer, I paid $300 for this just last year.
$20.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, Homer, be reasonable.
Sorry, no cash for Neddy.
Homer keep all money.
Bye-bye, Neddy.
All right, Homer.
$20? $20.
I don't want it.
What?! It was a passing fancy.
Although, if you threw in a few lawn chairs maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
Hey, Bartely-boobely.
Care for a steakarooni? Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious, dear old duddely-doodely.
[ Homer.]
Duddely-doodely.
This is the Flanders' living room set.
What did you pay for this? Only 7 5 beans.
$7 5? Ned must be desperate.
I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this you scavenger of human misery.
Hey! Keep your hands off my china hutch.
I'm Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills? Oh, I know I need to pay them, but there's just so many.
Do you feel good owing money? We've been very patient with you, Mr.
Flanders.
I know, but-- Wait a minute.
I'm Homer Simpson.
Ned Flanders lives over there.
Oh.
Flanders is in debt? Are you sure? We don't make mistakes.
Damned right-handed ledgers.
I can't write in these things.
There's a store You're Homer Simpson? See you Thursday.
D'oh! Knock 'em dead, boy.
Kid's going to be a black belt in no time.
Ohhh Check out the saxophone.
Pretty boss but something's stuck on it.
Hey! Hey, look at me.
I'm Elvis, man! Give that back! That to me! If you want it, take it.
Okay.
We're sorry.
This time, we're really going to give it to you.
Hey, stop that! Hey, Lise, something wrong? Not anymore! You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine.
This is my brother, and he knows karate.
Uh-oh.
Oh, we're real scared.
Please don't hurt us, Bart.
What are you going to do? Throw your diapers at us? Just keep laughing.
It only makes him madder.
Start them off with the Touch of Death and go from there.
I think they've learned their lesson, Lise.
We want to see the Touch of Death.
Come on, Karate Kid.
Waste me.
It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
Homer over here.
Flanders, I want to give you your stuff back.
Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer.
Not since that nice fellow from the bank-- who was only doing his job-- came and locked it up.
You're living in your car? Oh, no.
It's just a camp-out tonight then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City.
What do you think, kids? The big city.
Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer.
You're head of the car till I get back.
Okay, Dad.
Listen to that singing.
Those poor fools.
Homer, I'm ruined.
I know.
At times like these I used to turn to the Bible and find solace but even the Good Book can't help me now.
Why not? I sold it to you for seven cents.
You know, ever since that barbecue nothing's gone right.
It's like there's been a curse on me.
It's all my fault.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke.
I didn't listen.
Homer, you were a true friend.
No, I was a swine.
Listen, Flanders.
Do you still have that store? For two more days.
Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters.
I hope they have better luck.
You open that store tomorrow.
Homer, there's no point.
I said do it! Hello,Jerry? Homer Simpson.
Remember last month when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me.
A left-handed corkscrew? Oh, baby.
''Kiss me-- I'm left-handed?'' That's a classic.
Whoa! It's Homer Simpson.
Tell him I went out.
He needs you to help Ned Flanders.
Ned is in trouble?! Smithers, I'm licked.
You open this can.
Okay, but you softened it up for me.
Hold it, Smithers.
I'll open the can.
But, sir, how? To the mall! I'll explain on the way.
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.
Come on, lefties.
What did I tell you? Homer? It's all here, and it's all backwards.
That's right.
The worm has turned, has it not, my tin-plated friend? Look at you-- You who were once so proud.
Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns.
My life today.
Wow! What an icebreaker.
Left-handed ledgers.
Now, I can write all the way to the edge.
Aha! Left-handed nunchukas.
Wow! The boys at the Diners Club will think I've gone quite mad.
Oh, I'll have that roadster as well.
Yes, sir.
Huzzah for the shopkeep.
Huzzah! Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors but you made us friends.
To Ned Flanders the richest left-handed man in town.
Everybody! - Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Good morning, world! Ow! Ow ow Good morning, Lisa.
What are you so happy about? Why shouldn't I be happy? It's a beautiful day, my homework is done I got my mojo working, and we're going on a field trip this afternoon.
And looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
Hmm Hey, it's not in here.
You stole it! No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart.
Hey, look what I got-- a genuine official police badge.
Calling all cars.
Come out with your hands up.
Hey, that's my badge, Homer.
That's Officer Homer.
Lousy prize-grabbing, badge-wearing Aah! You ate my homework? I didn't know dogs really did that.
Wait! Wait! D'oh! Bart Simpson, you're late.
Go fill out a tardy slip.
But I'm only five That's pretty damn late.
Come on, over this way.
Hey, girls look at me! You can stop looking at me now.
Ooh! Well, it's nearly 1 :00.
You know what that means.
That's right-- it's time for our field trip to the chocolate factory.
Did you remember your permission slips? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Ugh! Oh, what a day.
I'm going to eat eight pieces of chocolate.
I'll eat it till I barf.
Don't worry, Bart.
We'll find something fun for you to do.
Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the P.
T.
A.
You're making me lick envelopes? Licking envelopes can be fun.
Just make a game of it.
What kind of game? Well, see how many you can lick in an hour.
Then try to break that record.
Sounds like a pretty crappy game.
Yes, well, get started.
Oh, my God! It's Cocoa Beanie himself.
I think this is something Bart would have enjoyed but it's the only way he'll learn.
Uh uh children, please.
Uh Welcome to the chocolate factory.
I'm Troy McClure.
You probably remember me from such films as The Revenge of Abe Lincoln and The Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West.
The history of chocolate starts with the ancient Aztecs.
In those days instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf.
Instead of being pure chocolate like we have today it was mixed with shredded tobacco and they didn't eat it-- they smoked it.
You didn't believe me when I said it would be fun, did you? No, thir.
My glasses! Please, kids, play sanitary.
Tan I doe now? What? ''Tan I doe now?'' Hmm Well, there's still a minute to go.
Oh, why not? But don't you tell your teacher I let you go early.
Die don't.
Aaaaah! Ugh! Aah! Unh! Son of a b Oof!.
What next? Uh-oh.
What's with the kid? Hands off the material.
What do you know? The kid's tough.
He's got spunk.
I wonder if he is lucky also.
Pick a horse, kid.
Shelbyville Downs, third race.
Make it good.
Eat my shorts.
Eat My Shorts.
Okay, let's see.
Hey, wait a minute, you little punk! That's the fifth race.
I said the third race.
Don't have a cow.
Don't Have a Cow in the third.
Put a deuce on him.
While we are waiting, let me show you around.
This is our bar and our slot machine and card tables.
Cool.
Boss, here's the call for the third race.
It's Suffering Succotash by a neck over Yabba-Dabba-Do, Ain't I a Stinker, and That's All Folks.
Here comes Don't Have a Cow flying on the outside and it's Don't Have a Cow.
I like this kid.
And we were gonna shoot him.
Can you mix drinks? I don't know.
I'll have a Manhattan.
Make Legs a Manhattan.
I'm not sure I Mmm, mmm Mm-hmm.
Well? Su-perb.
You got a job? Doing what? Uh, I don't know.
Mixing drinks, picking horses cutting cigars-- a job.
Your father and I don't want you doing that.
Homer, say something.
What does it pay? Thirty bucks a week.
I make more than that.
I was looking for those.
Thanks, doll.
Duh It's funny because it's true.
Well observed.
Chief Wiggum, you honor us with your presence.
Baloney! I won't rest until one of us is behind bars--you.
You know anything about a cigarette truck that got hijacked on Route 401 ? What's a truck? Don't play dumb with me.
Relax, Chief.
You seem tense.
You know, the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan.
Ah! I'm still going to put you away.
Good for you.
Bart! Have you started smoking? No.
Don't lie to me, boy.
Uh-huh! Cigarettes.
Just as I thought.
My boss said his warehouse was full.
Yeah, right.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes.
Then maybe you'll learn.
Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods.
In here, my man.
You look good with that cigarette-- kind of sophisticated.
Son, I'll never doubt you again.
The contents of the hijacked truck some 1 2,000 cartons of Laramie 1 00s.
We have Please! We have a number of leads and let me assure all you smokers there is no shortage of cigarettes.
How do we know that? Let me refer that back toJack Larson of Laramie Tobacco Products.
Thank you, Chief.
Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor is already heading toward Springfield and the driver has been instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks.
Police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster William ''Fat Tony'' Williams.
Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city and I am the Uh, what cures cancer? Bart, is your boss a crook? I don't think so although it would explain an awful lot.
Me and the boys thank you for hanging on to this for us.
Thanks.
Uh say are you guys crooks? Bart, um is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family? No.
For a large starving family is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread? Uh-uh.
And what if your family don't like bread? They like cigarettes.
I guess that's okay.
Now, what if instead of giving them away you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away? Would that be a crime? Hell no.
Enjoy your gift.
Su-perb.
Give me three fingers of milk, Ma.
It's good he has a part-time job but I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for.
I think they're criminals.
Ajob's a job.
If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town by your logic, that would make me a criminal.
Bart's been acting very strangely and that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks.
How long does it take to deliver a pizza? Our cover's blown.
Let's roll.
See? It was all your imagination.
Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them.
See what kind of people they are.
Please, Homie.
Oh, all right.
Hmm.
Read 'em and weep, boys.
Another pair of sixes.
Beats me.
I was bluffing.
You win again, Homer.
I am thrilled your boy can continue to work here.
If you need a hat-check girl, I've got a daughter.
Homer, you're a hell of a father.
Homer! What did you find out? The only thing going on down there was male bonding.
More stink lines, boys.
Hmm? What are you boys doing? You didn't see nothing.
Now, beat it.
So, Fat Tony, you invite me and my associates to your club with the promise of the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield.
Now you say your bartender isn't here? I don't know what happened.
Louie, make up some Manhattans.
I only know how to make wine spritzers.
Now! What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan? Mmmmm Come on, boys.
The kiss of death.
That's all I need.
lousy Skinner.
You are late for work.
Of course I'm late for work! Principal Skinner kept me after school.
Is Skinner causing you trouble? He sure is, patron.
Hmm.
Perhaps we should go to meet and greet this individual.
Come on, boys.
Some large men to see you, sir.
I don't have an appointment with any large men.
You Skinner? I'm Principal Skinner, yes.
And how did you get past the hall monitors? Children, I don't know how to break this to you but Principal Skinner is missing.
Uh-oh.
- [ Gasps .]
- What.
.
? Mm-mmm.
I thought I found him, but it was only a cat.
- Chief Wiggum? - Chief Wiggum? Please, I assure you we'll be using the most advanced scientific techniques in the field of body finding.
I see wedding bells for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy.
If we could just stick to Principal Skinner.
Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits.
Willie Nelson will astound his fans by swimming the English Channel.
Really? Willie Nelson? He loved fire drills.
Will you get a hold of yourself, lass for the wee bairns.
Hey! Look at me! I'm Skinner's body.
That is not funny.
I heard he's buried under his parking spot.
I heard he was ground into hamburger for lunch.
I heard Bart had him killed.
That's just a rumor.
You're engaged in speculation.
I know the law.
You can't prove anything.
Wuhaa! You killed me! - Nuhh - Nuhh You killed me, Bart! You k-k-killed me, B-Bart.
Reverend Lovejoy! You've come to comfort me? Yes, Bart.
There, there.
There, there.
Kill my boy.
Kill my boy.
There.
You're eight hours early for work.
I like that.
Did you kill my principal? Chinese guy with a moustache? No.
My principal.
That Skinner guy? No, we didn't kill him.
You're all under arrest for the murder of Seymour Skinner.
What's a murder? Don't play dumb with me.
Cuff them, boys.
Oh, Bart.
Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys? Wait till I get you home.
Who's that guy? Lionel Hutz, attorney.
I'll be defending you on the charge of murder one! Wow.
Even if I lose I'll be famous.
That Simpson boy is looking at 1 80 years.
Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a child can be tried as an adult.
I didn't order this guy killed.
Aren't you the head of this gang? No.
I just stop by the club to read the complimentary newspaper.
Then who is the kingpin, the capo di tutti capi? That's the guy.
Hey! Forgive me, Don Bartholomew.
We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn't quit.
Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers The kid liked to wet his beak in everything.
You've been his father for ten years.
Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate? Well, not the leader I mean Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit.
In light of the testimony from your gangsters, your father your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters this court has no choice but to Stop! Principal Skinner! I thought he was dead.
I suppose you're wondering where I've been.
It all started a week ago.
I was at my desk updating the school dress codes when I was confronted by toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson or so they said.
We think the boy has promise.
Get out! To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers.
Suddenly the pile fell.
I was trapped.
Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
I stayed alive by eating my mother's preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball.
I made a game of seeing how many times I could bounce the ball, and breaking that record.
The police arrived to search my home.
Find anything, boys? No sign of him.
Princess Opal? I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta Burke and Major Dad.
They seemed so happy.
I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me.
I'm in here! Well, let's go.
Okay, Chief.
I realized if I was ever getting out I had to do it myself.
I formed a crude rocket from a cigar tube.
Remembering an experiment from my days as a science teacher I concocted a fuel from baking soda and lemon juice.
The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide dragging a vacuum cleaner cord.
I grabbed the vacuum cleaner pushed the cord-retractor button and was on my way to freedom.
And that's my courageous story.
The prosecution moves that this testimony be stricken from the record.
Denied.
Case dismissed.
Your Honor uh, do I still get paid? I hope there are no hard feelings.
Get bent.
I deserve that.
I know we let you down, but me and the boys we still think you've got a big future in racketeering and extortion.
I used to think your gang was cool but now I learned that crime doesn't pay.
Yeah, you're right.
Blood on the Blackboard:: The Bart Simpson Story starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony Jane Seymour as the woman he loved and Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson.
Let's get out of here.
Shut up.
Where do you want it, Skinner? Not smart.
- Cool! - When do we get the check for this? They changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us.
You know who the real crooks are-- those sleazy Hollywood producers.
Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Here's good news.
According to this article S.
A.
T.
scores are declining at a slower rate.
I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King.
This is the only paper in America not afraid to tell the truth-- that everything is just fine.
''To me bestest bud Milhouse.
Happy birthday, Bart.
'' Bart, that's so sweet.
May I see the card? ''I couldn't afford to get you a new drum--'' Eww.
Come on.
Open it! Open it! Uh maybe a little later, Bart.
Just 'cause your mom didn't let you have a party-- We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse.
I liked the balloons.
I liked the party hats.
What do you mean? Nothing.
Twins.
Open your present.
They're Krusty the Klown walkie-talkies! I'll keep one and you keep one.
Whenever you want to talk to me call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie.
I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday-- jellybean baskets, personalized noisemakers-- but the little touches are what made it enduring.
What's he talking about? Hey, look at that dog.
Isn't that something? Wow! Brown.
Whoa! Springfield Elementary, last stop.
And by the way, I'd like to say applause, applause to birthday boy Milhouse for his totally bitchin' party on Saturday! Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof.
You did have a party.
You didn't invite me.
And I thought we were best friends.
Sorry, Bart.
Bye, little dudes.
Don't learn anything I wouldn't learn.
Ah, Monday morning.
Time to pay for your two days of debauchery you hung-over drones.
T.
G.
I.
M.
, sir.
What did you do this weekend, Smithers? I caught up on my laundry wrote a letter to my mother.
I took Hercules out to be clipped.
Who the devil is Hercules? My Yorkshire terrier.
He's tiny.
You know, it's a joke.
Here's a picture of Hurky.
Wheww.
Well, don't you know how to paint the town red.
May I ask about your weekend? A bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it.
I took in a movie.
A piece of filth featuring a blonde harlot who spent half the film naked as a jaybird.
Give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending and they'll oink for more.
What a movie! And that blonde-- does she have assets! Heh-heh-heh! Sounds like my kind of flick.
And how! Eww! Lemon.
Ugh! Cherry.
Ooh custard.
Mmm purple! Otto, welcome.
Apu, hey.
Got a bad case of the munchies, man.
Time for a heat-lamp dog.
Did you know there's a child in your bus? Good thing you warned me.
I was heading to Mexico.
Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on.
Vilma Banky did more with one raised eyebrow than an entire-- Warning.
Problem in sector 7-G.
Good God! Who's the safety inspector there? Uh, Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent? Actually, he was hired under ''Project Bootstrap.
'' Thank you, President Ford.
Huh? Noise.
Bad noise.
Five minutes before critical mass.
Critical wha-- ? Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they can handle it.
Huh? It's my problem! We're doomed! Sector 7-G is now being isolated.
My best friend shafted me.
I'll never get over this, Otto-man.
Sure, you will.
My old lady ran off and married my brother.
It hurt, but it's a month later, and I'm sleeping on their couch.
Marguerita I want you.
Mr.
Devereaux, I can't work under these conditions.
Have it your way, baby.
You're fired.
Oh, Avery.
Call me Mr.
Devereaux.
We interrupt Search for the Sun for this bulletin.
Forget the hair.
Just give me the blush.
Oh, we're on.
This station has learned that a crisis is in progress at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
Oh, my Lord! On the line is plant owner C.
Montgomery Burns.
Oh, hello, Kent.
Right now, skilled technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction but I can assure you and the public that there's absolutely no danger whatsoever.
Things couldn't be more shipshape.
Where's my radiation suit? How the hell should I know? People are calling this a meltdown.
That's one of those annoying buzz words.
We prefer to call it an ''unrequested fission surplus.
'' Homie, please, be all right.
Got to think! Somewhere there's a thingy that tells you how to work this stuff.
The, um manual! The manual, right.
Aha! It's as fat as a phone book! ''Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator D'oh! Get to the point.
Ooh, what's this? D'oh! Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated? There may never be another time to say I love you, sir.
Oh, hot dog.
Thank you for making my last few moments socially awkward.
Looks like this is the end.
That's all right.
I couldn't have led a richer life.
After the meltdown, expect roving bands-- I don't like this program.
Change the channel.
traffic for hours.
Wheel of Fortune! I don't understand anything.
When they look up ''stupid'' in a dictionary there will be a picture of me.
Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground I'll try to be a better Christian.
I don't know what I can do.
Um oh, the next time there's a canned food drive I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix.
One minute to core meltdown.
Shut up! Simpson, it's all up to you.
It's show time! Okay, okay, think back to your training.
This may well save your life one day.
- Homer? - Yeah? This button controls the emergency override.
In a meltdown, push this button, and only this button.
Ooh, a side.
- Simpson! - What? You see which button? Yeah, yeah, push the button.
Got it.
This is all your fault! Got to pick a button.
One potato, two potato-- No, wait.
Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish.
How many pieces do you wish? No! No! I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry ass good-bye.
May I, sir? Ughh.
These unfortunate people will be instantly killed.
This circle, which I am sad to say we are in will experience a slower, considerably more painful death.
Good Lord! They called me old-fashioned for teaching ''duck and cover'' but who's laughing now? Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.
Catch a tiger by the toe.
If he hollers, let him go.
Eeny, meeny, miney moe.
All systems returning to normal.
Danger in 7-G neutralized.
Have a nice day.
Whew.
Will I ever see you again? Sure, baby.
Next meltdown.
Heh.
I'd like to solve the puzzle.
''Three loins in the fountain.
'' We've isolated the problem.
Wouldn't you know-- false alarm.
It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system.
Your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken.
This reporter promises to be less vigilant in the future.
Excellent.
Well, ta.
Smithers, I can still sell them snake oil.
Now, bring me a wine spritzer and don't be stingy with the vino.
Yes, sir.
So, Smithers it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson our next employee of the month.
Milhouse, a little salt? Sure.
Ohh! Ha-ha-ha.
Now we're even for your party.
Come on, let's go play.
My mom won't let me be your friend anymore.
That's why you couldn't come.
What's she got against me? She says you're a bad influence.
Bad influence, my butt! Never listen to your mother.
She threatened to cut off my allowance.
Whatever she's paying you I'll double it.
I'm really sorry.
Sir, if you'll recall I'm the one who put a five-percent ceiling on the Keogh plan-- You bean counter, give it up.
Simpson's my man.
Hey, way to save our lives.
Yeah, we owe you one.
Well, you know, boys a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman-- you just read the manual and press the right button.
Simpson? Monty Burns.
Come with me.
Homer! Homer! Homer! Now, now that will do.
Homer, for your bravery and skill we award you this ham, this plaque this discount coupon book and my own personal thumbs-up.
Ahh! Hah! And to ensure your immortality your heroic visage will be added to our wall of fame.
Oh, and what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ''Magic''Johnson? MagicJohnson?! Yello.
Is this Homer Simpson? Yeah.
Homer, I just used our last time-out to call and congratulate you on averting nuclear holocaust.
Well, thank you.
If you play on that ankle, you'll be in pain.
I don't care.
Magic, what if people think a guy's a hero but he was just lucky? Sooner or later people like that are exposed as frauds.
Thanks, Magic.
Oh! Aaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Hee-hee-hee-hee! Bart, you're not laughing.
Too subtle? No, I'm just depressed.
Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him anymore.
Homer, did you go out and buy a 20-pound ham? What's all this? D'oh! ''For heroic competence.
For narrowly averting a meltdown and proving without question that nuclear power is completely safe.
Employee of the month!'' Oh, Homer! Ohh.
A role model in my very own home.
How convenient.
Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work.
I don't need it here at home.
How are you enjoying your ham? Tastes so bitter, it's like ashes.
It's actually more of a honey glaze.
Maybe you ate a clove.
What's your problem, boy? I had a fight with Milhouse.
You don't need friends like that four-eyes.
How Zen.
What? What is it? What you doing? Looking at you with quiet awe.
As long as it's quiet.
Milhouse to Bart.
Milhouse to Bart.
Please don't hate me.
Please? Ooh, right next to the boss.
Aw, he'll never know who did it.
Ah, Simpson, there's someone I want you to meet-- Aristotle Amadopolis owner of Shelbyville's nuclear power facility.
Huh? What? Ari's been having terrible worker problems.
They've lost their zest for work.
Help them find their eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve.
Their eanae-haratou-doola what? We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from donut-eating goof-offs into Homer Simpsons.
I can't tell them anything.
Cut the false modesty! It's tiresome.
Besides, employee of the month isn't all ham and plaques.
Well, Smithers.
How kind of you to pay us a visit.
Couldn't help it, sir.
Parking here is terrible.
This man has no love for his power plant.
Begone from my sight.
That one's always been a problem.
One, two, three.
''Community Chest.
'' Nah.
Nah.
Ah! I've won second prize in a beauty contest.
Collect ten bucks.
Ha, ha! You're losing.
Bart, don't feed your sister hotels.
Don't worry.
There's tons.
That game is too old for her.
Go play with Milhouse.
I don't want to.
You haven't made up? His mom says I'm a bad influence.
Let's go throw rocks at that hornets' nest.
Mrs.
Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother.
We met when the boys drank paint.
I remember.
Please come in.
Marge, I'm sorry but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn't see your son.
Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside.
He's got a spark.
It's not a bad thing.
Of course, it makes him do bad things.
Well, Marge, the other day Milhouse told me my meat loaf sucks.
He must have gotten that from your little boy because they certainly don't say that word on TV.
Well, I can't defend everything he does but let's face it.
All Bart and Milhouse have is each other.
They're too young for girls and they're a popular target for bullies and in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep.
Please, please, let them be friends.
I'll think about it.
So the next time somebody tells you carny folk are good, honest people you can spit in their faces for me.
If you'll excuse me I'm profiling my dad for the school paper.
I thought I'd follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick.
Aw, that's sweet.
I followed my dad to a lot of bars too.
One beer, one chocolate milk.
Excuse me, I have the chocolate milk.
Oh.
What's the matter, Homer? Alcohol's depressing effects don't kick in till closing.
He's a little nervous.
He has to give a speech on keeping cool in a crisis.
What will I do?! What will I do?! I gave a speech once.
I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick.
I pictured everyone in their underwear-- the judge, the jury, my lawyer-- everybody.
Did it work? I'm a free man.
Milhouse to Bart.
Do you want to come over and play? Really? We can be friends again? Did your mom die? Uh I don't think so.
Well, who cares? Milhouse, I'll be right there.
Sorry, Maggie.
Game's over.
Hey, Mom! I'm friends with Milhouse again.
I knew his mother would come to her senses.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
Who says I did it? Who else would? Aw you be good.
I will.
As I look into this sea of smiling faces I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion.
You are not workers.
You are a pack of mangy, cud-chewing, ugly goats.
Well, you're in for a treat.
We have with us today a real man.
Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson.
Uh ''ladies and gentlemen.
'' Just picture them in their underwear.
Whew! Ahh! ''Grace under pressure is no--'' Three minutes to meltdown.
Whew! Saved by the bell.
Just do what you did before.
All right.
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.
Catch a tiger by toe.
If he hollers, let him go.
Eeny, meeny, miney moe.
Crisis has been averted.
Everything is super.
Thank you, Homer, for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming! Do you even know what button you pushed?! Sure-- moe.
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.
Is Homer a hero? The answer is no.
I'm Kent Brockman and that was ''My Two Cents.
'' Now, Scott Christian with ''Laugh and a Half.
'' Thanks, Kent.
There was more dumb luck today when Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank holdup without even trying.
It seems the chief had gone to the bank to cash in his penny jar.
48, 49, 50.
What the-- ? Ooh! Good work, Chief.
Just doing my job.
Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpson of his own.
Whoa! Huh? A pretzel? Wow! Looks like I pulled a Homer.
MagicJohnson coming down the floor.
His feet slip out from under him! The ball flies loose, hits the referee goes in the basket! It's a three-point play! The Lakers win! Looks like I pulled a Homer.
Our dad! Now he belongs to the ages.
Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! I hold in my hand the final ax.
Ah, heh That's all the time we have for today.
I'd like to thank Sideshow Mel Corporal Punishment, Tina Ballerina and from Knots Landing, Miss Donna Mills.
Oh, she was a sport.
See you some other time! Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! Great show, Krusty.
I really laughed when-- You've got a merchandising meeting.
- Cancel it! - Therapist? Cancel it! The line on the Giants is 5Â½/.
Put a dime on it.
''Thank you'' dinner with Bart Simpson? I don't know Bart Simpson.
The boy who saved you from jail.
Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake.
Ah won't happen again.
There was one boy who trusted me all along.
- Bart? - Yes, sir? Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
Cancel it! Hello? Mrs.
Simpson? Lois Pennycandy, Krusty the Clown's assistant.
Hello, Mrs.
Pennycandy.
It's Miss Pennycandy, I can assure you.
I'm sorry to inform you that Krusty will not be joining Bart for dinner.
This is the fifth time he's cancelled.
How can he hurt someone who loves him so? Oh, Mrs.
Simpson I've wasted my womanhood asking that same question.
I apologize for him.
Something really important came up.
Lousy mildew! That's good enough.
Well, thank you for calling.
Good-bye.
How many Krusty autographs do you want? A hundred.
Done.
Sweetie, I'm sorry but Krusty isn't coming to dinner again.
Oh, man.
''Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson ''Krusty buddy number 1 6302 ''respectfully returning his badge.
''I always suspected that nothing in life mattered.
''Now I know for sure.
Get bent.
Bart Simpson.
'' Ooh, SEX-CHAT! You've reached the party line.
You'll be connected to a hot party with the world's most beautiful women.
Now let's join the party.
Hello? Hello? Hello? Are there any women here? Hello?! Are you beautiful? Do I sound beautiful?! This is not as hot as I had anticipated.
Read this! Uh-- I, um-- Uh-- Uh-- ''Dee--'' Uh-- ''Deee--'' ''Dear ''Krus-s-s-t-- Why--?'' It says the little boy who never lost faith in you has lost faith in you.
You will go to Bart Simpson's for dinner! But I have plans.
Hey! Not the face! Why you maddening, impossible man! If you don't go tonight I won't be here tomorrow.
Oh, all right, I'll go.
Oh, Krusty! But I hate missing schnapps night at the Friars Club.
Bart, wipe your feet.
Why bother? They'll just get dirty again.
I've got good news.
Krusty is coming to dinner tonight.
He is? For sure? Yes.
God bless that clown.
Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! You think it's him? Cute kid.
Oh, hi, Bart.
I was just in the neighborhood-- What? Krusty the Clown! What a surprise! Milhouse, you can come in, and drop the charade.
Whoa! You don't have to be on tonight.
What are you talking about? Of course he does.
No.
Krusty is our guest.
Your pratfalls and punchinello antics aren't necessary here.
Really? Yeah.
Just relax and be yourself.
Oh, that's a relief.
Go wait in the car.
Aw! We could have seen a monkey.
Who wants to say grace? Let's let our guest do it.
Bless us, O Lord-- Hey! Krusty, do the honors.
Well, all right.
I'm a little rusty, but, um I'll try.
Baruch ata Adonai Eloheinu melech ha-olam ha-motzi lechem min ha-aretz.
He's talking funny talk.
No, Dad, that's Hebrew.
Krusty must beJewish.
AJewish entertainer? Get out of here! There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner and Mel Brooks.
Mel Brooks is Jewish?! Krusty, are you all right? Yes, it's just that saying the Brucha brings back a lot of painful memories.
The old days my-my father.
Hey, Krusty, you going to finish that meat loaf, or what? Poor Krusty.
He's like a velvet painting come to life.
Krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? Spill your guts.
Yeah.
Come on.
Krusty, tell us.
Well, okay.
First of all my real name isn't Krusty the Clown.
It's Herschel Krustofski.
My father was a rabbi.
His father was a rabbi.
His father's father-- Well, you get the idea.
My father was the most respected man in the Lower East Side of Springfield.
People would come from miles around to ask his advice.
Reb Krustofski, should I finish college? Yes.
No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Rabbi, should I have another child? Yes.
Another child would be a blessing.
Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler? Could you rephrase that as an ethical question? Um is it right to buy a Chrysler? Yes-- for great is the car with power steering and Dyna-Flo suspension.
Papa? When I grow up, can I be a clown? No! A clown is not respected.
I'll make people laugh.
Herschel, life is serious.
Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying.
Pie is for noshing, not for throwing.
But, Papa-- But nothing! You'll do as I say or you'll get such a zetz that you won't even know what hit you.
Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps but the pull of clowning was too strong.
I got my first laughs at yeshiva impersonating my father.
Blah, blah, blah Moses! Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps.
Don't worry.
I don't even like using the bathroom after you.
Why, you little-- Krusty, please continue.
Okay.
My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug but it was no use.
What are you doing? Go away.
Open the door! Oy, gevalt! Close the door! Then came my big break.
A Talmudic conference in the Catskills.
I was the entertainment.
But the lord works in mysterious ways.
My son, Herschel was first in his yeshiva class.
He was voted most likely to hear God.
Go on, Hyman, you're exaggerating again.
A rabbi never exaggerates.
A rabbi composes, he creates thoughts he tells stories that may never have happened but he does not exaggerate.
My father would have never suspected a thing were it not for one rowdy rabbi.
Hey, funny man! No, no, no! Herschel? Herschel, oy vey iz mir! You have brought shame on our family.
If you were a musician or a jazz singer this I could forgive, but this? I never want to see you again, you--you clown! I haven't seen my father since.
That is so sad.
Do you think about your father a lot? All the time.
Except when I'm at the track.
Oh, look! Aww hmm.
Oh, look at you, Bart.
Oh, isn't that fun! Ooh, hey! Whoa! Oh, Fourth ofJuly.
I can't believe that little boy is you, Bart.
Yeah.
I got a lot of fond memories.
Look at the time.
Almost midnight.
Do you have any yearbooks? You've seen everything.
Milhouse, know any ''knock, knock''jokes? I want to go home.
Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home.
Gladly.
Wow! The Concert for Bangladesh.
Good night, Krusty.
Sorry about your dad.
Don't worry about me.
I'm a survivor.
Did I leave my keys? No! Oh, here they are.
Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! Ehh Hmm ah uh ohh! Academy Award Playhouse now returns you to Hercules Versus the Martians.
Welcome to our spaceship, mighty Hercules.
Heh-heh.
Hello? Hello?! Anybody there? I hear a phone ring I'm listening, and there's no talking.
Why would they call if they don't want to talk? Huh? Hee-hee-hee! Aahh! Aahh! Didn't ItchyJunior look happy playing with his father? And didn't ScratchyJunior look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by the thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to the commercial! Poor Krusty! A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
We've got to do something.
Let's move.
Reverend Lovejoy we need you to help us find a rabbi.
Well, before you make any rash decisions let me remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs of young Christians.
We're not converting.
We just want to find a Rabbi Krustofski.
I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night.
- Really? - I didn't know that.
I mention it in my sermon every week.
Oh, that radio show.
It's all the kids talk about on Monday at school.
Well, why don't you have a free T-shirt? You'll be the coolest kids in the playground.
We'll put them on later.
Can you give us the rabbi's address? Oh, sure thing.
Let me check my non-Christian Rolodex.
I bet he misses Krusty.
He'll be so happy, he'll cry in his beard.
Oh, yes, yes.
Rabbi Krustofski? What can I do for you, my young friend? We came to talk about your son.
I have no son! Great, we came all this way, and it's the wrong guy.
I didn't mean that literally! And in order to keep our broadcasting license we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal.
In that spirit, we bring you Gabbin'About God sponsored by Ace Religious Supply, where they say ''If we don't got it, it ain't holy.
'' With us once again, our very own three wise men-- Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daly and Rabbi Hyman Krustofski.
Our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights.
With all the suffering in the world do you ever wonder if God really exists? No.
Not for a second.
Not at all.
Good conversation there.
Our next call now is for the good rabbi.
Hello? I hear breathing, but I don't hear talking.
What's going on? Hello? Mister? Some people got nothing to do but call and hang up.
There's all kinds of mishagoyim.
Our next caller is a Springfield boy.
My name is Dmitri.
I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener.
If a son defies his father and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy shouldn't the father forgive the son? I think so.
Of course.
Absolutely not! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? They leave a building without people watching it? I got a plan that can't fail.
Yiddle, my man, you're a genius.
I love my work.
Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know.
But what if your example encourages others to give? Speaking of charity don't you think it's time you forgave your son? My boy broke my heart! He turned his back on our traditions on our faith, and on me.
Get out of here, you little pisher.
Oy, this guy's tough.
We'll have to outsmart him.
He's pretty sharp.
He saw right through this disguise.
What? Saul Bellow? The Nobel prize-winning Jewish novelist? He wants to have lunch with me? It's a date.
Izzy's deli, 1 :00.
I'll be there.
The French government wants to give me the Legion of Honor? Where do I receive this prestigious award? Izzy's deli, 1 :00.
Thank you, Monsieur President.
Au revoir.
Are you kids ready to order yet? Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles.
Watch how fast I go.
And for you, sir? I want a nice sandwich, but theJoey Bishop-- too fatty.
TheJackie Mason-- makes me gassy.
The Bruce Willis? I don't like his work.
What is this-- a Krusty the Clown? Ham, sausage and bacon, with a smidge of mayo.
What? On white.
You tell Mr.
Saul Bellow the Nobel prize-winning Jewish novelist that I lost my appetite.
Could you direct me to President Francois Mitterand's table? You think you're funny? can't be wrong.
We've been going about this all wrong.
What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else? Those stupid hats? No, Bart-- knowledge.
We'll hit him where it hurts-- right in theJudaica.
''Glub, glub, glub.
'' ''Oh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us!'' ''No!'' This looks good, Bart.
Take it to him.
You I told to go away.
Does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud ''a child should be pushed aside with the left hand and drawn closer with the right''? Yes.
Your religion commands you make up with Krusty.
But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says ''Honor thy father and thy mother.
'' End of story.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Not quite.
I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon Ben-Eliazar.
''At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar.
'' Bart, my short, learned friend, the Book ofJoshua says ''You shall meditate on the Torah all day and all night.
'' Hmm.
Is it not written in the Talmud ''who will bring redemption? The jesters.
'' I'm still not convinced and this is hardly the time to discuss it.
Here you go, Bart.
It's a long shot, but that's all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew.
Bart, I am not going to learn ancient Hebrew.
Rabbi, did not a great man say and I quote, ''TheJews are a swinging bunch of people.
''I mean, I've heard of persecution ''but what they went through is ridiculous.
''But the great thing is after thousands of years ''of holding on and fighting they finally made it.
'' End quote.
I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently.
Was that Rabbi Hillel? Nope.
Judah the Pious? Maimonides? The Dead Sea Scrolls! I'm afraid not, Rabbi.
It's from Yes, I Can, by Sammy Davis,Jr.
An entertainer, like your son.
The candy man? Maybe I'm completely upside down on this whole problem.
All the years of joy that I've lost.
Why? Because of my stubborn ways.
There, there, Rabbi.
It's not too late.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hi, kids.
Today's show's going to be the funniest, side-splittingest cavalcade of-- Aw, the hell with it.
Roll the cartoon.
Oh, yeah.
My old friends, right next to my heart.
Hey, such a filthy habit.
Who asked you? Father? Son.
Papa! Herschel! Daddy! Boychick! Oh, Daddy! You're on, Krusty.
Oh, uh-- Boys and girls I'd like to be serious for a moment, if I may.
Spotlight, please.
I just wanted-- I just want-- Come on, guys.
I'm not doing the spotlight bit.
Let's have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father Rabbi Hyman Krustofski.
Lenny a little reconciliation music, if you please.
Come on, Dad.
You know the words.
I got something in my eye.
Take my hankie.
Eeyugh! We haven't seen each other in 25 years! Oh, I love you, son.
I love you, too, Daddy.
Oy, a klop tsu deer! Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk! Shh!

Hello, everyone.
Before last year's Halloween show I warned you not to let your children watch but you did anyway.
Well, this year's episode is even worse.
It's scarier, more violent and I think they snuck in some bad language too.
So please, tuck in your children and-- Well, if you didn't listen to me last time you're not going to now.
Enjoy the show.
to conclude this Halloween newscast on a scary note: remember, the presidential primaries are only a few months away.
Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia.
Trick or treat, man.
Aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes.
Hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house.
Here you go, kids.
Heh-heh heh.
Lousy punks.
- D'oh! We're home.
Aah whoo! Get a good haul this year? Jackpot! I'm very, very proud of you kids.
We would have gotten more if Lisa walked faster.
I didn't select this costume for mobility.
I wore it to salute the noble Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest.
Yaahh! Ha-ha-ha! Children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for-- If you eat too much, you'll have nightmares.
Oh, yeah, everybody in this family will have a bad nightmare tonight.
Oh, yeah, three bad nightmares.
I'd like to see that.
Heh-heh-heh.
Ooh.
What a dump! Why would Princess Grace live here? - Dad, that's Monaco.
- D'oh! I can do that, but I don't want to.
Ugh! What is this thing? It is a monkey's paw, dating back to Al-Al Ben Abdallah.
It grants wishes to its owner.
Oh, yeah? How much? I strongly advise you, do not purchase this.
Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune.
I was once president of Algeria.
I don't want to hear your life story.
Paw me.
Eww, Homer.
Where did you get that ugly thing? Why, at that little shop right over there.
Oh, it was over there.
You'll be sorry.
Flight 7, Marrakesh to Springfield, now boarding.
Just a moment.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! They're souvenirs.
You must pay a fine of two American dollars.
Okay.
Let's wish for X-ray specs that really work.
No, Bart-- peace on Earth.
- X-ray specs.
- Peace on Earth.
- Peace on Earth.
- X-ray specs.
- X-ray specs.
- Peace on Earth.
As the pants-wearer of this house I get the first wish.
Homer, there's something I don't like about that severed hand.
Marge, don't flake out on me.
That monkey's paw is going to make our dreams come true.
- Oh, no! Maggie made a wish.
Oh, my land! Ooh.
! A luxury car.
- Good baby.
Good Maggie.
Ohh, a new pacifier.
D'oh! No more fooling around.
Paw, this is Bart.
I wish for Simpsons to be rich and famous.
Now you're talking.
- Yay! - Yay! Wahoo! Look, everybody.
My purse exploded! Come on, everybody.
We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town.
I'm terrible sorry.
I have absolutely nothing untilJune.
Ah, the Simpsons! Right this way, please.
Homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say.
If I hear one more thing about the Simpsons I swear I'll scream.
At first they were cute, but now they're annoying.
What a rip-off.
Man, this thing's really getting out of hand.
Is there anything they won't do? Oh, Homer, this is awful.
The guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune.
I thought he was being colorful.
I wish for world peace.
Lisa, that was very selfish of you! Sorry about the Falklands.
Oh, forget it.
We knew they were yours.
Well, won't be needing these anymore.
# Come on, people now, smile on your brother # # Everybody get together # # Try to love one another right now ## Foolish humans.
Oh, yes, Kodos.
Earth is now ripe for the plucking.
People of Earth, we come to you in the spirit of hostility and menace.
Now, we can resolve our differences peacefully.
Uh ow! Your superior intellect is no match for our puny weapons.
Gordon, do something.
What do you want me to do? I'm a baker now.
Conquered with a club.
Wish we'd saved an A-bomb.
Move along humans.
This is all the Simpsons' fault.
Before I was just bored with them now I wish they were dead.
Geez, now we're slaves.
This paw sucks.
Okay, I'll make a wish that can't backfire.
I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread with lettuce and mustard and and I don't want any zombie turkeys.
I don't want to turn into a turkey myself and I don't want any other weird surprises, you got it? Hey! Hmm mmm! Mmm not bad.
Nice hot mustard, good bread turkey's a little dry-- The turkey's a little dry?! Oh, foul the cursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee? Hey, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things? Yeah, but I got to warn you that this thing is-- Yeah, that's what it is.
You want to try it? Okely-dokely.
Ooh, would you look at that.
Aahh! Kneel before my slingshot, puny earthling! Well, I guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens.
Aahh! He's got a board with a nail in it! Enslave humanity, will ya?! Run, Kodos! Ha-ha-ha! Well, Kang, it seems the earthlings won.
Did they? That board with the nail in it may have defeated us but the humans won't stop there.
They'll make bigger boards and bigger nails.
Soon they will make a board with a nail so big it will destroy them all! Hey, Homer this thingumajig works great.
Now that I've saved the Earth maybe I ought to spruce up the old homestead.
I wish I had a monkey's paw.
Bart? Bart? Huh? What's the matter? I had a bad dream.
Could I sleep in your bed? No.
I'll give you a candy necklace.
Climb aboard.
- Thanks, Bart.
- Less talk, more sleep.
[ Rod Serling Impressionist .]
Presented for your consideration:: Springfield-- an average little town with a not-so-average monster.
Happy thoughts.
Happy, happy, happy.
The people of Springfield have to make sure they think happy thoughts and say happy things because this particular monster can read minds.
And if displeased, can turn people into grotesque walking terrors.
Happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.
Boy, I'm getting mighty sick of this.
Huh? Ruff, ruff, ruff.
Bow-wow.
And did I mention that the monster is a ten-year-old boy? Quite a twist, huh? Betcha didn't see that one coming.
Good morning.
- Morning.
- Good morning, dear.
Hiya, Bart.
How's my boy? [ Nervous Laughing .]
Every day, same old cat.
I'll make him more interesting.
Much better.
Oh, good, the curtains are on fire.
It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart.
It's real good.
- Hadn't you better get ready for school? - Okay.
He gets it from your side of the family, you know.
No monsters on my side.
- Hi, guys.
- Aahh! Hi, Otto.
Move over.
I'm driving.
No can do, little buddy.
See, there's a rule-- Oh, wait.
You're the little dude with the gnarly powers.
Quit riding the brake.
Give it some gas, man.
Hey, this is fun, isn't it? We're going to die, aren't we? - Hiya, Bart! - Hiya, Bart! [ Teacher .]
Well, class the history of our country has been changed again to correspond with Bart's test answers.
America was now discovered in 1 942 by ''some guy.
'' And our country isn't called America anymore.
It's Bonerland.
Your attention, please.
This is Principal Skinner.
Bart, this one's for you.
Phone.
Happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.
Moe's Tavern.
Hold on.
I'll check.
Uh, hey, everybody.
I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt and my butt smells and I like to kiss my own butt.
- That's a new one! - Wait a minute.
One more time.
Double-time now.
I love school.
Come on, come on.
Make it, make it.
Please, please, please.
- I want to watch Krusty.
- Shut up, boy.
If they make this field goal, I win 50 bucks.
The kick is up.
It's looking good.
The ball is turning into a fat, bald guy.
Aahh! Oof!.
It's no good, and you know what we say Every time something strange happens-- it's good that Bart did that.
It's very good.
and all because of one little boy who-- who won't let me stop! Anyway, now let's go over and see if Sideshow Mel has any more of those legal over-the-counter wake-up drugs of his.
Slowly, slowly.
Don't make a sound.
Don't even think.
He can hear your thoughts.
Then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in.
End of monster.
Aaaaaaaaaahhh! Bart! - Lisa did it.
- That's it, young man.
You're coming with me.
Please? You like attention, don't you, Bart? - Do I ever.
- But you don't care whether you get good attention for, say getting high marks in school, or bad attention for, say turning your father intojack-in-the-box.
Homer, I see you agree with my theory.
I'm not nodding.
It's the air conditioning.
That's too bad.
The attention the boy craves should be coming from you.
Spend some quality time with him.
Get to know him.
Maybe even love him.
- [ Cheering .]
D'oh! Whoa-oh-oh.
Eeyii! - Good night, son.
- Good night, Dad.
You know, these last few days have been really swell.
I wish I could repay you.
Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.
You got it.
Oh! Hey, hey.
Oh, oh.
Thanks, boy.
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, son.
Aaaaaaaaahhh! Mom! Dad! My goodness! What's wrong? - We both had nightmares.
- Can we sleep with you? You both toilet trained? - Yes! - Okay, then.
Couple hours I have to get up and go to work.
Got to go to work.
Go to work-- [ Burns .]
Ooh, look at them, Smithers-- goldbrickers, layabouts, slugabeds.
Little do they realize their days of suckling at my teat are numbered.
Oh, in the meantime, sir, may I suggest a random firing -just to throw the fear of God into them? - Very well.
Eeny, meeny, miny-- Blugh! Him! Attention, Homer Simpson.
Attention, Homer Simpson.
Wake up, Homer.
- What? Huh? What? - You're fired.
- For what? - For sleeping on the job.
How did you know I was sleeping? We've been watching you on the surveillance camera.
Camera? D'oh! Smithers to the laboratory.
You know, Smithers I've always despised the laziness of the common worker.
Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak.
I replaced the flesh, which is weak, with steel which is strong.
Behold! The greatest breakthrough in labor relations since the cat-o'-nine-tails! - How long till it's running? - Keep your pants on, Smithers.
First we need a human brain.
Hey, here's a goodjob, Dad.
You have to know how to operate an ultrasonic lithontriptor.
- How hard can it be? - Hey, Dad, here's one.
$28 an hour, plenty of fresh air and you get to meet lots of interesting people.
Ooh, what job is that? Grave digger.
Deeper, wider, faster.
I wouldn't bury my turtle in that mud puddle.
What's the use? Sheesh! What a slave driver.
What corpse should we unearth, sir? I don't know.
I feel like a kid in a candy store.
Hello! An open grave.
Smithers, get him out quickly.
The stench is overpowering.
Wait a minute, sir.
That's Homer Simpson.
He wasn't exactly a model employee.
Well, who is a model employee? Simpson will do just fine, sir.
Did you hear that, sir? No, I didn't.
Who is it, Frankenstein? The Boogerman? The man in the bag.
I think he's alive.
Oh.
- Bad corpse.
Stop scaring Smithers.
Satisfied? Thank you, sir.
Excellent.
Smithers, hand me that ice cream scoop.
- Ice cream scoop? - Damn it, Smithers! This isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery! All right.
Hello.
Look at me-- I'm Davy Crockett! Look, Smithers, a twitch.
It's moving! It's alive! Oh, that fellow at Radio Shack said I was mad.
Well, who's mad now? Hi, there.
I'm your daddy.
[ Homer's Voice .]
Mmm! Mmm! Sprin-kles.
Geraldo Rivera Madonna, and a diseased yak.
[ Lisa .]
Mom, what's wrong? It's your father-- he's missing.
Dad's missing? Get out of here.
He's been gone for two days.
What do you know? She's right.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
It was supposed to be a thing of beauty not this abomination.
Oh, Smithers, I was wrong to play God.
Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with.
Take out that brain and flush it down the toilet.
His family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body.
Come on.
It's 1 1 :45! Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy-dog eyes-- All right.
Ow.
Ow.
- Ow.
Ow.
- Quit your complaining.
Do you know what this means? He is alive.
Ooh, you're right, Smithers.
I guess I owe you a Coke.
And as for you, you clinking, clattering cacophony of collagenous cogs and camshafts, take that.
! Aahh! - Run, sir.
Every bone shattered organs leaking vital fluids a slight headache, loss of appetite.
Smithers, I'm going to die.
- Is there nothing I can do? - Well, perhaps.
Smithers, go to my office.
In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether.
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh! Did you have a nightmare? - No.
Bart bit me.
- You were crushing me.
I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
Got to shake the dew off the lily.
- Aahh! - Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads.
My body was crushed, so I had head grafted onto your shall we say, ample frame.
I can wake up.
It's all a dream.
It's just a dream.
Oh, that's right.
It's all a dream or is it? Next week on The Simpsons: Don't forget, Dad.
Tonight my class is having an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner.
Mmm.
Spaghetti.
But, Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.
Oh, I hate having two heads.

Ahhh, the Simpsons D'oh! Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh, what? Hello? Dad, the school talent show-- I know, it's tonight.
I broke my last saxophone reed.
I need a new one.
Isn't this something your mother's better at? I called her.
She's not home.
I also tried Mr.
Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr.
Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.
Wow.
And after them out of all the people in the world you chose me.
Uh-huh.
Number 4Â½/ reed.
Got it.
You're in for a whale of a show tonight.
The doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out after your own child has performed.
Let me caution the people in the first five rows-- You will get wet.
Just in the nick of-- Mmm.
Beer.
I've only got five minutes till the music store closes.
Go there first.
Do I tell you what to do? Sorry, Homer.
Tip the glass.
Sorry, Homer.
This is a whole lot of nothing.
I'd rather watch the boilers.
Make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria.
I'm not kidding.
Ah finished, with 1 5 seconds to spare.
Ah! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! What's the matter, buddy? The moron next door closed early.
I happen to be that moron.
Oh, me and my trenchant mouth! Oh, terrible,just terrible.
They seem to get worse every year.
Ha, ha, ha! Wonderful! This is the best batch we've ever had.
And now, here's Bart Simpson the boy of a thousand voices.
I'd like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner.
Duh, look at me.
I'm Principal Skinner.
That young man just became the boy of a thousand days detention.
I wonder what lunch lady Doris has for us today.
Today's special is refried dog poop.
Please! You've got to open that store.
Let me think about it.
Uh no.
Okay, but I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing.
Well, I don't have one.
Come on,Jer.
Open up.
I pulled you out of that burning car.
Okay, but now we're even.
What does your daughter need? I wrote it down.
''Number Number 4Â½/--'' Stupid gum! ''Number 4Â½/ reed.
'' Whoo-hoo! Mm-hmm.
What instrument does she play? I don't know.
Mom, where is he? If I don't get that reed, I'll sound terrible.
Don't worry, honey.
I'm sure your father is maybe-- No.
That's a long shot.
Bingo.
Don't worry.
He'll be here.
- Clarinet? Oboe? - No.
- Saxophone? - No.
What was that last one? Saxophone.
Hmm Lisa, stop playing that stupid-- Saxophone! That's it! Alto or tenor? D'oh! This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen I'd like to put this filth behind us and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of''Stormy Leather.
'' Uh, ''Weather.
'' Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawn mower.
Ew, I'd hate to be that kid's father.
Uh-oh.
That will do.
It's not my fault.
It's the reed.
Oh, yes, of course.
It's the reed.
Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax.
Yeah! Whoo! Must be her father.
Whoo, yeah Who ordered a Mount Bellyache? I ordered it for my little girl.
I'm done.
Oh! That cost $88! I don't feel much like eating.
Look, I let you down and I apologize.
I know that doesn't make it right.
I hope you can forgive me.
I forgive you.
D'oh! You didn't mean that.
No, I didn't.
Look, Homer Lisa's taking her first steps.
You're taping it? Yes.
I'll watch it later.
The plane, the plane! No, my freakish little friend.
Hmm.
Da-da.
Da-da.
Did you hear that, Homer? Marge, please-- I'm busy.
No wonder she hates me.
Oh, I never even noticed she was alive.
If you want to make up with Lisa spend some time with her.
Ohh! Okay! Ahh! Maybe I should give up on Lisa and make a fresh start with Maggie.
Stop looking for the quick fix.
If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you.
If I spend any more time doing girl things I'm going to, you know, go fruity.
No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea.
Let's see-- quick fix, quick fix.
I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.
We can't afford it.
With today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to.
Ridiculous.
When I look in Lisa's eyes I don't see love.
That's no reason to buy a pony.
When you yell at me, I see love in your eyes.
Stick to the subject.
Uh-huh you love me Let's be realistic.
A pony is expensive.
We have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Promise me you won't buy a pony.
Hmm.
Was that a yes or a no? Baa.
Those aren't even words.
Sna.
Oh, my, what's that smell? Oh, it's you.
Excuse me.
Do you sell ponies? Sure, pal.
Right here.
''Scottish Deer Hound.
'' Hey, this is a dog! My friend, you're smarter than I gave you credit for.
I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401 .
Merely take a left at the rendering plant.
Lady, I'm buying a pony for my little girl and I don't care what it costs.
Very good.
That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.
Half a million dollars?! He was sired by Seattle Slew.
His mother won the Kentucky Derby.
His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania.
Sold.
Mr.
Simpson, do you have half a million dollars? Sure, let me write you a check.
Mr.
Simpson this check is dated January 1 , 2054.
Is there a problem with that? Our ponies start at $5,000 cash.
Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home? I sincerely hope not.
I'd like to borrow $5,000.
Sorry.
I can't approve a loan that size myself.
Hello.
''Simpson.
'' How can I help you? Mr.
Burns, you do this personally? It's a hobby.
I'm not in this for personal gain.
Are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws? Usury? Silly me.
I made up a word that doesn't exist.
What is the purpose of this loan? I want to buy a pony.
Isn't that cute? He's planning on joining the horsey set.
That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it? It's for my little girl because she doesn't love me.
Shut up, Simpson.
You have any collateral? Smithers, let's not be so cold.
His spirit is my collateral.
Just sign this form and the money will be yours.
Sorry, I was just thinking of something funny Smithers did today.
I didn't do anything funny, sir.
Shut up.
Mr.
Simpson are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony? Of course.
Simpson, you've done it again.
Oh! I love you, Dad! Mmmmm.
I am very upset with you.
Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
How come Lisa gets a pony? She stopped loving me.
So get me a moped.
I know you love me, so you don't get squat.
Snowball II, Santa's Little Helper-- This is Princess.
Please don't exclude her because she's different.
Where were you planning to keep this horse? I've got it figured out.
By day, it will roam free around the neighborhood and at night, it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
Dad, no! That's illegal.
That's for the courts to decide.
Marge, she loves me.
Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable.
Stable? That sounds expensive.
This is what love costs a month? These are standard fees, Mr.
Simpson.
Plus, I'm teaching your daughter riding, grooming and at no extra charge, pronunciation.
You've made me the happiest girl who ever lived.
Oh, nuts.
What do I do? What do I do? If you want to go right move the joystick left.
Yes.
Move the-- What's a joystick? Oh, oh! Here comes a Xylon cruiser! Go into hyperspace! Wait! Where's the hyperspace? Grandpa, you're the spaceship.
I thought I was this guy.
- Oh! - Oh! Game's over.
I got down on the floor for this?! Wait, Dad.
I've got something for you.
I was hoping it would be money.
Hmm, dear.
We're in serious trouble here.
We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.
Well, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have.
We could cut down on beer.
We're not going to do that.
Then there's no choice but to give up the pony.
First you didn't want the pony.
Now you want me to take it back.
Make up your mind.
Homer! Lisa loves me.
The pony stays.
You got us into this.
You get us out.
There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work.
Do you have any jewelry you don't need? Mmmmm.
You're so beautiful.
Oh, you haven't touched your salt lick.
Num-num.
Good salt lick.
Need money.
Need money.
One scratch-for-cash.
Here you go.
Liberty bell.
Two liberty bells.
Come on, come on, come on-- Oh.
Yes! Whoo-whoo! Three liberty bells! That will be $1 0,000, Apu.
Congratulations, Mr.
Homer.
Thank you.
If I could see the ticket-- There it is.
Please to be removing your thumb.
No.
Yes, please.
I must insist.
No.
No.
You can't see-- Yes, I must-- No! Let go! You're ripping it.
A cherry.
Oh, Mr.
Homer what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery? Oh I need money.
If you need money you should have jammed a gun in my ribs or inquire about my help wanted sign.
You need help? Someone for the demanding high profile midnight to 8:00 a.
m.
shift.
I'm your man.
You're hired.
I dreamed of the day one of you would work for me.
She certainly tamed that horse.
But what man can tame her? I won't lie to you.
On this job, you will be shot at.
Each bullet wound is a badge of honor.
''Badge of honor''-- Here's a pointer.
Try taking it in the shoulder.
These hot dogs have been here for three years.
They are strictly ornamental.
There is only one bozo who comes in and buys them.
But I eat-- Oh.
The perfect crime.
Homer, where have you been all night? I was so worried.
Let's go in the other room.
I did something I'm ashamed of.
The kids can't hear it.
Busted.
I'll work midnight to 8:00.
Come home, sleep five minutes eat breakfast, sleep six minutes, shower.
I have ten minutes to bask in Lisa's love Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.
Oh, my God, she killed him.
Mmm.
Salty.
Homer! Are you stealing Squishies? No, sir.
This next song is also about a girl and her pony.
It's called ''Wildfire.
'' Come on, Apu, honey, loosen up.
Ohh! I'm sorry, baby.
While I'm here with you my store is going down the tubes.
Three dollars and 51 52 53 cents.
Homer, you are asleep at your post! Go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, baby.
Date's over.
Homie, how long do you plan to do this? I don't know.
How long do horses live? D'oh.
Mustn't sleep.
Must monitor core.
Hello? I called to say I love you.
Thanks.
When is she going to stop loving me? I heard Milli Vanilli was arrested for impersonating a McNugget.
Well, it's still fun to be up late.
Hey, Homer, where you going? Going for eight-hour walk.
Homer.
Homer.
Homer sleep now.
What's wrong with Dad? He's just exhausted.
Lisa, do you know what it costs to keep a pony? No.
Well, it's a lot.
Your father had to take a second job.
Poor guy.
Where's he working? The Kwik-E mart.
I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up.
You're making me give up Princess? We can't make you.
I can make her.
Give me five minutes alone with her.
No, Bart.
No one's making her.
Lisa has to decide for herself.
All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult have blown up in my face.
Hey! When I ordered that blueberry Squishy, I meant today.
Coming right up, sir.
And fill it to the top time.
Yes, sir.
She likes a little carrot after her oats and she likes it when you scratch her behind the ear.
She likes contemporary adult radio in the morning and easy listening at night.
Please take good care of my Princess.
Although there is no change in my patrician facade my heart is breaking.
I'll never forget you.
What the? You call this melted cheese receptacle clean? The young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
You see, Lisa grown-ups have a thing called money.
Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me.
That's why I gave up the pony.
You did? There's a big dumb animal I love more than that horse.
What is it, a hippopotamus? I mean you, you dummy.
Oh.
Apu, you can take this job and restaff it.
Giddy-up, Dad! He slept, he stole he was rude to the customers.
Still, there goes the best damned employee a convenience store ever had.
Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Products you could only imagine before.
The Foam Dome.
TheJet Walker.
Mr.
Sugar Cube.
That baby changed our lives.
I'm actor Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such TV series as Buck Henderson, Union Buster and Troy and Company's Summertime Smile Factory but I'm here to tell you about Spiffy the 21 st century stain remover.
Let's meet the inventor-- Dr.
Nick Riviera.
Thank you, Troy.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Dr.
Nick.
Troy, I brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul, Edgar Allan Poe.
One of our best writers.
Yes, but unfortunately a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore.
I guess we're gonna have to throw it away.
Not so fast, Troy.
With one application of Spiffy you'll think the body's still warm.
Ooh! Ahh! ''Quoth the raven--'' What a shine! Ooh! That's one clean tombstone.
- Dad, you got a power drill? - In the garage.
I'm offering three bottles-- enough to clean 1 ,000 tombstones-- for only $39.
95.
Boo! I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better, Doctor.
Yeah, give us a break, Doctor.
But how can I make it lower than $39.
95? Find a way.
I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.
- If stuff starts flying just turn your head.
- Check.
Okay.
I'll throw in a fourth bottle the applicator glove and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold-- $29.
95.
- D'oh! D'oh! Okay.
Okay, calm down.
Homer, can you get the door? It's my sisters.
- Homer, be nice.
- Okay, I will.
I will.
Coming over here-- Patty, Thelma, what a pleasant surprise! What do you know.
He's wearing pants.
I owe you lunch.
Ugly.
Ugly.
Butch.
What's the matter? Can't you find a hairstyle you like? Hold the phone.
That's the one for me.
- Ed Asner? - No, next to him.
Mary Tyler Moore.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Expiration date,June 1 989 uh, 201 2, yeah.
Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again? Shh! They'll hear you.
Oh, who's using the power tools? I don't know.
Some guy, I guess.
We're going to the beauty parlor.
You should do something with the kids while I'm gone.
Oh, sure, great idea.
I'd love to.
D'oh! Did you hear that? - Yes.
- How much? - Everything.
- What's the quickest, easiest way to do something with you? Take us to the video store? Anything for my little girl.
Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame.
Stupid kid.
Ooh! McBain.
Mm-mm-mm.
McBain, you keep eating them hot links you never gonna make it to a pension.
- Come on, live a little.
- No, thank you.
I got me a future.
I'm two days away from retirement.
My daughter's graduating from college.
Little Suzie is growing up.
As soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted.
We just christened a boat.
Yes, sir, everything is gonna be just perf-- Aaah! Damn, damn, damn.
McBain.
- Yes? - I'm not gonna make it.
Oh, stop talking crazy.
Just do one thing for me.
Get Mendoza.
Mendoza! - You want to rent it, sir? - Why? I just saw the best part.
Ooh.
Death by Knockout, Blood on the Ice.
Ho, ho! Football's Greatest Injuries.
- Lisa, we're going.
- But I can't find Happy Little Allison Tinkly-Winkly Town.
Just grab something.
All these movies are great.
Look at this.
''Test your F.
Q.
-- Fatherhood Quotient.
'' Maybe you should try it on Homer.
He'll fail it.
Uh-huh.
In a second.
Well, I don't know.
Oh, now Henry Winkler, there's a father.
Listen to what he told a close friend.
''I don't always keep my cool like the Fonz but my love for my kids has given me plenty of happy days.
'' Mmm.
They call him the Galloping Gazelle.
His habitat-- the frozen tundra of Soldier Field.
For six seasons and two Pro Bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone until one fateful Sunday in November when the Gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Shashefski.
Homie, we're back.
Don't mind that clod, Patty.
You could turn the world on with your smile.
Could you turn off the TV? - There's a test I want you to take.
- Oh, great.
You made me miss Joe Theisman.
This is from the National Fatherhood Institute.
It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Oh, Marge.
Question one.
''Name one of your child's friends.
'' Uh, let's see, Bart's friends.
Well, there's the fat kid with the thing.
The little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.
They want a name, not a vague description.
Okay.
Hank? Hank? Hank who? - HankJones.
- Homer, you made that up.
Question two.
''Who is your son's hero?'' - Steve McQueen.
- That's your hero.
''Name another dad you talk to about parenting.
'' - Next.
- ''What are your son's hobbies?'' He's always chewing on that phone cord.
- He hasn't done that since he was two.
- Then he has no hobbies.
Oh, really? Maybe you should go out to the garage and see.
Bart.
Bart! - What? - Do you have any hobbies? - No, not really.
- Well, that's what I-- Wait a minute.
What are you doing? - Building a soap box derby racer.
- D'oh! That's a hobby.
Hey, so it is.
Oh, my God.
I don't know jack about my boy.
I'm a bad father.
You're also fat.
I'm also fat! National Fatherhood Institute.
Please hold.
National Fatherhood Institute.
- Dave speaking.
- I'm Homer Simpson.
I just took your test.
I got a zero.
Good Lord! A zero? Lana, cancel my 1 :00.
Mr.
Simpson, we'll send a wood-paneled station wagon over for you immediately.
Hey, Bart, where did you get the lumber? As three-time derby champ Ronnie Beck says ''Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine.
'' A conventional design.
Yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin? In between other projects.
If you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel.
Good-bye, son.
Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away.
Maybe it's for the best.
For starters, Mr.
Simpson take this copy of Fatherhood by Bill Cosby.
If he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold.
If you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.
That's easy for you to say you preachy, egg-headed institute guy.
- How much do you see your son? - Why don't you ask him yourself? - Homer, meet Dave,Jr.
- Huh? How's your research, son? I think we're near a breakthrough.
- Good work.
- Thanks, Dad.
Oh, how I envy you.
That back and forther you witnessed didn't happen overnight.
It took years of effort.
- I've never been afraid of hard work.
- That's the spirit.
Step one-- find an activity to share.
Does the boy have any interests? - What boy? - Your son.
Find something he likes and share in it.
Well, he is building a soap box derby racer! Oh, that would be perfect.
Dear God! Not again! Bart, I'm gonna help you build that racer.
Thanks, but I'm almost done.
- Get back on the couch and watch TV.
- Okay.
No! I'm gonna do it.
Sorry, Dad, but three-time soap box derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help.
But you can use me.
I'm good.
I built a lot of things around the house-- the spice rack the bird feeder the Gymboree.
What was that? Ah, who cares? Son, please let me help you.
Come on, Dad.
It would be weird.
This isn't working at all.
It's hopeless.
Wait a second.
Hmm.
''Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity.
''No matter what you tell your child to do he will always do the opposite.
'' Huh? Don't you get it? You gotta use reverse psychology.
That sounds too complicated.
- Okay, don't use reverse psychology.
- All right, I will.
Son, I don't think you should let me help you.
If you really want to help, clean these paint brushes.
Thank you, Bill Cosby.
You've saved the Simpsons.
You know, Marge, that Bart is a little miracle-- his winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach his face alight with wholesome mischief.
He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.
Hmm, yeah.
- I like our chances, son.
- Ugh! Your father's not supposed to help build your racer - but you should at least consult him about it.
- D'oh! You're in heat four.
Whoa.
Where's your helmet? Helmets are for wusses.
I can't let you go without a helmet.
He's my son, and if he doesn't wanna wear one, you can't make him.
Okay, fine.
I wanna get out of here sometime today.
Attention, everyone.
To those questioning the value of the space program behold! Ay, caramba! Hey you can't smoke in the pit area.
Fine.
Hey, Simpson where's your losermobile? Losermobile.
Wait a minute.
Uh, it's over there, Nelson.
Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap.
I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy.
- Same here.
- Careful, boys.
It took me months to steal that bumper.
Help! Help! - What was that? - You didn't hear nothing! - You nervous, son? - Don't worry, Dad.
As three-time soap box derby champion Ronnie Beck says ''Gravity is my copilot.
'' Hey, boss.
Just in case you need it.
Ahh, thanks, guys.
Now get out of here! Oh, I didn't realize this hill was so high.
Could I have another-- Deploy, damn you! Deploy! It hurts! It hurts! Owee! Owee! Owee! Ow! Mm-hmm.
Young man, this stress fracture will require you to be in a cast for six weeks.
That means I can't possibly race.
You're lucky to be alive.
Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor.
Is it okay to visit? Of course.
Hey, man, cool crash.
- Way to cheat death.
- Thanks, Bart.
You had the best stick there.
I wish I could build 'em like you.
That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you.
I'll never race again.
If you don't race, Nelson will win.
Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it.
Unless-- Bart, will you drive my car? I don't know if I should.
My dad and I built our car together.
If I drove someone else's, it'd kill him.
On the other hand, I'll do it.
We've got a lot of work to do on the car.
I'm pulling you out of school for two weeks-- I don't know how to say this, but I don't wanna drive your car.
It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart.
The car has a few bugs, but we're Team Simpson.
Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win.
- When did I teach you that? - I picked it up somewhere.
If I drive Martin's car, I can win.
- I'm sorry, but-- - No, go ahead, leave me.
- Dad-- - Go on and win.
Go on and win without your dad.
I'll just sit here in Li'l Lightnin' which the Simpsons built and remember that for one brief shining moment I had a son.
Ow.
Ohh! Dad.
Can you take me to Dr.
Hibbert's? Why? What's wrong? I scheduled a tetanus booster.
Maybe I'm being a little anal but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.
Sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car.
This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa? D'oh! Martin, your bone is healing nicely.
Tell me something I don't know.
Dr.
Hibbert, Lisa needs a-- You! Home wrecker! Mr.
Simpson, you have every right to be angry.
But rest assured, your son loves you.
You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies.
- Dad, aren't you coming? - No.
- Now, don't pout.
- I'm not pouting.
You are.
You gotta come.
I just got your hat out of the fridge.
- Sorry.
- Don't you have something to say to Bart? [ Homer.]
No.
Can't think of a thing.
I've always said you were a good father.
I've always defended you when people put you down.
- That's for sure.
- She ain't lying.
But I guess I was wrong.
You are a bad father.
Leave me alone.
Good morning, everybody and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the Great Depression-- the soap box derby.
In just minutes these junior Al Unser,Jrs will lock horns.
Huh? ''Name your son's hobbies.
'' Building a soap box racer.
''Name one of your child's friends.
'' Martin.
Martin! I'll curse that name till the day I die! Huh? ''Who is your son's hero?'' Three-time soap box derby champion, Ronnie Beck.
Wow.
I'm one question away from being a perfect father.
''Name another dad you talk to about parenting.
'' - Ohh! - Hey-hey-ho, Simpson.
Shut up, Flanders.
Flanders! Flanders! Flanders.
Uh-- Uh-- When should a boy start dating? - There are two schools of thought on the subject-- - Great! Thanks! I talked to Flanders about parenting! I'm a perfect father! Hold on, son.
I'm a-comin'.
My friend and I have a bet.
Are you Mary Tyler Moore? Ooh! Wow! It really is you.
If she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands or you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators.
- What did I just tell you? - Kill spectators.
What is the matter with you? It's my dad-- lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV.
I've never seen him like that.
Forget about your father! You're driving for me now.
Do it for your old man, boy.
Simpson, prepare to die.
Let's rock.
Ladies and gentlemen to drop the green flag-- our beloved mayor Diamond Joe Quimby.
To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor.
Check out the rack on the blond in the fourth row.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Ha! Ha! Like the elegant Roman in Judah Ben-Hur these modern charioteers battle ferociously.
No quarter given; none asked.
The world has not seen the likes of this since the French carried Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders from Le Bourget Field.
And now, to present the trophy three-time soap box derby champion, Ronnie Beck.
Congratulations, Bart.
Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories.
Thanks, Mr.
Beck.
I was alone out there but someone was riding with me in spirit.
This is for you, Dad.
No, son, you earned it.
I might remind you both I did design that racer.
The driver is essentially ballast.
The better man won, Simpson.
You can really drive.
Thanks, Nelson.
Put her there.
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha Loser! Na-na, na-na-na You know, there is such a thing as being a bad winner.
Mom, I never won before.
I may never win again.
Na-na, na-na-na That's my boy.
# Na-na, na-na-na # Na-na, na-na-na Shh!

## The Simpsons ## D'oh! Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and this is Eye on Springfield.
[ Rock And Roll Instrumental Theme Playing .]
Wow.
Info-tainment.
Tonight we salute the silver anniversary of the Great Springfield Tire Yard Fire.
and still burning strong.
We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man.
He's not so fat.
And we visit with heavyweight champion Dredrick Tatum who reminisces about growing up in Springfield.
It was a dump.
If you see me there, you know I up bad.
But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at the bikini.
Whoa-- T and A! Why are you still up? - Lisa's slumber party.
Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me? They've got better things to talk about than you.
Sheesh, what an ego.
Lisa, your brother is so gross.
You should smell his room.
Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes that's what your husband's job will be.
It's a mop.
My husband will be a janitor.
That looks like an Olympic torch to me.
He could be an athlete and go on to have a great acting career.
It's a dustpan.
The wax never lies.
Let's play truth or dare.
Truth or dare! Truth or dare! I'll take dare.
I dare you to kiss Lisa's brother.
Eww!! What the.
.
? Aaaaahh! I'm telling mom and dad.
Who? Mom and dad.
Jinx! You can't talk till somebody says your name Coming up next: An elephant who never forgets to brush! What is it, boy? Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man.
Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad? Because I'm jinxed, damn it! Ow! What was that for? You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you.
Sorry, it's the law.
There he is.
Let's give him a makeover.
Run for it, boy! Get him! Get him! Get him! Aaaaahh! Oof!.
Come here, Maggie.
Huh?! That's it, I'm out of here.
Hiya, Homer.
What's the matter, Moe? Oh, business is slow.
People are healthier and drinking less.
If it wasn't for the junior high school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.
Yeah, things are tough.
Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants.
Got a beer? Yeah, sure.
Oh, sorry.
I forgot we're out of beer.
Aahh! I got behind on my beer payments.
The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the love tester.
You're too late, Homer.
Barney sucked it dry.
Cut his gums up pretty bad.
Ohh! Take it easy, Homer.
I learned how to make other drinks at bartender's school.
Gin and tonic? Do they mix? Hey, I know a good drink.
Really hits the spot.
I invented it myself.
One night, Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their vacation.
And this is Patty trying to plug her razor into those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets.
As you can see, we never got the hang of it.
Ay, caramba! As I stared at that hairy drumstick I knew I needed a drink.
Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment? If you're going for a beer, this is the last one.
D'oh! I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids'cough syrup.
It passed the first test-- I didn't go blind.
They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea but Selma sank right to the bottom.
Huh?! I don't know the scientific explanation but fire made it good.
Sounds like one hell of a drink.
What do you call it? A Flaming Homer.
Why don't you make us up a couple of Flaming Homers? You got any cough syrup? Let me check the lost and found.
Bowie knife, troll doll glass eye Oh, here we are.
It's not without it's charm.
Try lighting it on fire.
Hmm?! Wow! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
Hey, your love tester's busted.
I want my nickel back.
Hey, buddy, have one on the house.
Hey, this drink is delicious and my phlegm feels looser.
What do you call it? It's called a Flaming Moe! It's called a Flaming Moe.
That's right, a Flaming Moe.
My name is Moe, and I invented it.
What are you looking at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe.
- Oh! - Oh! Hey, what's this? A sneeze guard.
Wow, it really works! It hasn't been this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps.
Think my drink had something to do with it? Who can say? It's probably a combination of things.
Another pitcher of Flaming Moes.
I hate this joint, but I love that drink.
Ohhh.
I couldn't help noticing your sign.
You mean, '' Bartenders Do It 'Til You Barf''? Above that store-bought drollery.
Why don't we fill out an application.
I'll need your name, measurements, and turn-ons.
You expect me to tell you that? You could, but I find this way is much more accurate, and fun.
Ugh! What salary do you offer? Minimum wage and tips.
Of course, there are fringe benefits.
Such as? An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.
I'd prefer to vacation someplace hot.
- Whoo! - Ha-ha! - Ow! - Whoo! I like your moxie, kid.
You're hired.
You shan't regret this.
Methinks I shan't.
Are you the genius behind the Flaming Moe? - Yes, I - I'm your man.
I work for Tipsy McStagger's good time drinking and eating emporium.
Oh, yeah? Hey, what's Mr.
McStagger really like? Tipsy McStagger is just a composite of other successful logos.
You tell him for me that he makes one great mozzarella stick.
Yes, I will.
I've got a proposition for you.
Your Flaming Moe is perfect for our chain.
We want to buy the recipe.
It's not for sale.
Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink? Uh figure of speech.
Sorry, Harv.
I'll be back.
Good for you, Moe.
Only an idiot would give away a million-dollar idea like that.
Ohhh.
The next time you use a gas chromatograph remember to thank Mr.
A.
J.
P.
Martin.
Brilliant, Martin.
Once again you've wrecked the grading curve.
I pity the student who has to follow you.
Bart Simpson, you're next.
''The Inventor I Admire'' by Bart Simpson.
The inventor I admire is not a rich man or a famous man, or even a smart man.
He's my father, Homer Simpson creator of # Dun-da-da-dah # The Flaming Homer! The Flaming Homer? You mean the Flaming Moe and your dad didn't invent it, you wuss.
Moe the bartender did.
Everyone knows that.
It's not true.
My father invented it.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Are those liquor bottles? I brought plenty.
Take those to the teachers' lounge.
Hey, Bernard! Good evening, Krusty.
Nice to see you, Bernard.
Thank you very much.
- Krusty, over here! - Krusty, one more! Henceforth, this date shall forever be known as Flaming Moe's Day.
Sir, this is Veteran's Day.
It can be two things.
Mom, instead of milk, can I have a virgin Moe? Honey, what's wrong? I'll tell you what.
That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe I gave him.
Take that off this second.
Okay.
Homey, why don't you go to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd share some of his success with you.
Nah.
Marge, I'm too upset to eat.
I think I'll go to Moe's.
D'oh! Oh! Hey! Can I help you? I need to see Moe.
Your name's not on the list.
I never gave it.
What is it? Homer Simpson.
Not on the list.
We're all filled up.
File off!.
Some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight.
Maybe we can get them to come up here.
How about a warm Flaming Moe's welcome for Aerosmith! Nah.
We're just hanging out.
Come on.
Free pickled eggs.
- All right! - Yeah! Hello, St.
Louis! That's Springfield, Steven.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Are you ready to rock? Yeah! I said, are you ready to rock! Yeah! Hit it! Barney? Hi, Homer.
I want you to meet my friends Armando and Raffi.
Hey, Moe, come on.
Get up here.
Do you want to ignite my drink? You're my kid's teacher.
Single parent, are we? No.
Let's pretend you are.
Get away from me.
Hey, Moe! Homer, how about a beer? I'd rather have a Flaming Homer.
A what? Oh, I get it.
How could you do this to me? This bar was going under, and my drink saved it.
My face should be on that crappy merchandise.
Morris, is what this man says true? It's hard to say.
He may have come up with the recipe but I came up with the idea of charging 6.
95.
Uhp-- telephone.
Flaming Moe's.
I'm looking for a friend.
Last name:Jazz.
First name: Hugh.
Hold on.
I'll check.
Huge ass? Somebody check the men's room for a huge ass.
I'm Hugh Jazz.
Telephone.
This is Hugh Jazz.
Uh hi.
Who's this? Bart Simpson.
What can I do for you? This is a crank call that backfired and I'd like to bail out right now.
Better luck next time.
Hmm, what a nice young man.
I'm sorry you're mad, but this isn't personal.
This is business.
Business, eh? Well, you just lost yourself a customer.
What? I couldn't hear you.
I said, you just lost a customer! - What? - You just lost a customer! You'll have to speak up.
You lost yourself a customer, Moe! I forced myself to what? You just lost a customer! We'll talk tomorrow.
You just lost yourself a customer! Yeah, you can use it.
Barney! How's the world treating you? Hey, there! What can I do for you, Harv? Tipsy McStagger would like to buy your drink.
He's here? No.
My company is willing to do what it takes to get that recipe.
We're prepared to offer you $1 million.
Sorry, Harv, but like I told you before it ain't for sale.
Don't be stupid! We have a lab for this.
We've figured it out, except for one ingredient.
Brace yourselves, gentlemen.
According to the gas chromatograph the secret ingredient is love?! Who's been screwing with this thing? I'm sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me.
- Sign here.
I got hooked on this in the service.
Ah! My new watering hole.
Yeah, what do you want?! A beer.
Okay, then.
Can I have a clean glass? Here you go, Your Majesty.
Next on Eye on Springfield a toast to Moe, wizard of Walnut Street.
The Flaming Moe dates back to my forefathers who were bartenders to the czar.
So, Mr.
Hutz, does my husband have a case? I'm sorry, Mrs.
Simpson but you can't copyright a drink.
Ohh! This goes back to the '7 8 Frank Wallbanger case.
How about that? I looked something up.
These books don't just make the office look good.
They're filled with useful legal tidbits.
Stupid Moe.
Non-inventing, recipe-stealing, pug-nosed maybe you can take consolation in that something you created I'm the magical man from happy land in a gumdrop house on lollipop lane.
Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.
Well, duh! Now, that's what I call a happy hour.
Morris, something troubles me.
My mother won't be home for another 20 minutes.
No.
I was thinking about Homer Simpson.
That's okay.
I was thinking about Sybil Danning.
I meant, I think you should sell your drink and give half the money to Homer.
But, honey He's your friend, Morris and you took advantage of him.
All right.
All right.
I'll split the million with Homer.
Jeepers, Mary and Joseph! I sleep with a chick once it costs me half a million bananas.
Moe, Moe, Moe Bart, are you going to mow the lawn today? Okay, but you promised me Moe money.
I Moe, I Moe.
Moe, Moe, Moe When Bart's done, can we Moe to the Moevies for the Moetinee? Of course.
All work and Moe play makes Moe a Moe Moe.
Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe? Moe Moe Moe.
Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe.
Moe Moe Moe Moe.
Moe.
Moe, Moe Moe Moe, Moe Moe.
Moe, Moe Hey, Homer.
Hey, Homer.
Hey, Homer.
Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.
Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.
Aaaaahh! - Hey, Homer.
- Hey, Homer.
Hiya, Homer! What's the matter? Aaaaaaahhh! Hey, where's Joey? [Joey .]
Mrs.
Krabappel I really need my drumsticks.
Come and get 'em! You're going to be a rich man, Moe.
The way we usually work is to steal the recipe and run the inventor out of business.
Ah, c'est la vie.
What the.
.
? Fools! You poor, pathetic misguided creatures choking down Flaming Moes all the time wondering, '' How does he do it?'' Well, I'm going to tell you.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! The secret ingredient is Homer, no! Cough syrup.
Nothing but plain, ordinary, over-the-counter children's cough syrup.
Shoot.
Thank you, Mr.
Nutball.
Got to go, Moe.
Tough luck.
Aaaaaaaahhh! Holy cow, you just fell on Aerosmith! Hey, Homer.
Come in here.
Hi, Moe.
Where's your waitress? She left to pursue a movie career.
Frankly, I think she was better off here.
Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Oh, hey, hey.
Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.
I guess so.
Compliments of the house-- One Flaming Homer.
Aw, thanks, Moe.
You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have.
Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight? I doubt it.
- Shh!

## The Simpsons ## D'oh! It's formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits.
Hot dog.
And mild enough to use daily.
Isn't life grand? What's wrong, sir? Did I get some in your eyes? The shampoo specifically said, ''No more tears.
'' A lovely promise but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo.
There's something you're not telling me.
Perhaps you'd talk to Snappy the alligator? Maybe.
Hello, Mr.
Burns.
Snappy, it's hard to imagine but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan.
I dreamed of grand slam home runs and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen.
There's still time for that.
Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress.
So you feel resentful towards the plant.
Yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl.
Mmm! Hmm?! D'oh! Ohh, what do they want? Maybe a nap will boost my spirits.
I'll get that whale song cassette you like, sir.
Oh, it's not fair! I know how you feel, Simpson.
I've never seen Mr.
Burns so depressed.
People think because he's rich and powerful and cruel he doesn't have feelings, but he does.
I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for $1 00 million.
Ooh, that's a lot of money.
D'oh! Uh Mr.
Smithers do you have change for a dollar? Good, good-- try to eat something.
Homer Simpson here.
It's your stockbroker.
Your stock in the plant just went up for the first time in ten years.
I own stock? All employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights.
So, how much did it go up? The book says to make small talk before getting down to business.
- Everybody alive? - Yeah.
- Like any sports? - Sure.
- Ever go dancing? - Not anymore.
- We should get together sometime.
- That'd be great.
There.
Now we trust each other.
Well, how are you? Near death! I renew my notary license on a weekly basis.
So what's my stock up to? Let me punch that up on the computer.
Uh 25Â¢ a share.
What should I do? Let me put it this way-- you'll get $25 if you sell now.
Sell! Sell! Sell! Whoo-hoo! Twenty-five dollars! Ooh! Mmm hot wax.
Oh, hammer.
##Fight, fight, fight fight, fight, fight ## # The Itchy & Scratchy Show # Mmm.
Bart, turn to the Financial Channel.
Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing.
Unconfirmed takeover rumors have pushed Burns Worldwide from 1 /8 to 52 and a quarter.
Your father's stock is worth $5,200! Wow! 5,200 smackers! Oooh! Ahhh Hey, Homer.
Want a Duff? No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K.
Duff's Private Reserve.
Are you sure? 'Cause once I open the bottle, there's no refund.
For your information I just made a cool $25 playing the market.
Buy low, sell high-- that's my motto.
I may quit my job at the power plant and become a full-time stock market guy.
Have a Duff, boys! Oh, thank you.
My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us.
Only a swine would drink this beer.
Thank you, anyway.
You aren't from around here, are you? We are from Germany.
He is from the east; I am from the west.
I had a big company, he had a big company.
Now we have a very big company.
We want to buy the power plant.
Would your owner ever sell it? Well, I happen to know he won't sell it for less than $1 00,000,000.
Ein, zwei, drei, vier, funf Oh, don't worry.
We'll have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns.
It's the miracle we've been waiting for.
What are we spending it on? Homer's probably buying some magic beans with it.
We'll have a savings account.
We've never had one.
Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on.
Hey, hey! Oh, Homer! You heard? We heard.
Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.
I'm afraid I had some great plans too.
What do you mean? I spent it on beer.
Surprise, surprise.
You spent $5,200 on beer?! $5,200? What are you talking about? What? I sold it all for 25 bucks! - Oww! - Come on, everybody.
It makes you feel better.
Hey, Homer.
Did you buy this car with your stock money? Sure did, and the great thing about it is everybody got rich.
For once us working stiffs got a break.
Wait till you see Lenny.
He just got back from the plastic surgeon.
Lenny, looks like you got the works.
It started as an eye tuck, but the stock kept climbing.
Come here.
Mr.
Burns is on TV.
Mr.
Burns? Here, Mr.
Burns.
Over here.
Mr.
Burns.
We've heard a German consortium offered to purchase the plant.
Any comments? You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you'll see Germans running my plant! Then why are you meeting with them? So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say, ''Nein.
!'' You never cease to amaze me, sir.
Hmm? Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! I grudgingly accept.
Now, don't worry.
You'll find these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie.
Hans and Fritz-- Why, that's justJohn and Frank.
Ich bin ein Springfielder.
They'll bring their own people in.
This ain't good.
We could all lose our jobs.
Look at all those worried faces except for Lenny.
He looks great.
This is the worst day of my life.
Those Germans can't fire me.
I'm the only one who can unjam the rod dissociator.
They can't fire me.
I run the gaseous contaminant particularifier.
They can't fire me.
- Why? - Why? 'Cause Guten morgen.
I am Horst.
I'm speaking with you because I am the most nonthreatening.
Perhaps I remind you of lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he does.
What is the best way to an efficient plant? - I don't know.
- Well, uh Search me.
Happy workers who feel secure at their jobs-- So let's get to know each other better.
Do we have any alcoholics among us? Uh me.
Right here.
I'm drunk right now.
You'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying-out facility in Hawaii after which you'll return at full pay.
- Oh, great! - Great.
Hey, maybe I'll marry Elizabeth Taylor.
Lucky drunks.
We cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety.
We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
Yeah, sock it to 'em, Horst! Psst.
Hey, Homer.
Aren't you the safety inspector? D'oh! Mm-hmm-hmm mm-hmm That's one big check.
You look sharp today, sir.
You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr.
You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr.
That was a gutsy decision, sir.
Smithers, come here.
I wanted to give you something and I know you wanted this photo of Elvis and me.
He was good to his mother.
Yes, but I couldn't understand a word that man said.
''Mr.
Burns hound dog.
'' Stop it.
You're killing me, sir.
Sir, what will you do next? I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for.
Then, who knows? Beekeeping? Boxing? Bocce ball? The world is my oyster, Smithers.
Farewell.
Lisa, your father needs your help.
Do you know anything about Germany? Well, it's a country in Europe.
Good.
I'm learning.
An economic power of the world.
Because we send them money? No.
They're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic.
D'oh! Oh, woe is me.
Homie, come to bed.
Oh, Marge, I'm going to be fired.
I know it.
Don't worry.
Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow.
Marge, it's not the money.
My job is my identity.
If I'm not a safety ''whatchamajigger,'' I''m nothing.
Well, if you can't sleep why don't you do something constructive? Ooh Battlestar Galactica.
! Fit, damn you! Fit! There.
Yo, Homer, you got to get ready for work.
Uh-huh.
What? What am I gonna-- Hey, you! Stop being so unsafe! Smitty safen up.
Could we have a word? No.
I must have phrased that badly.
My English is inelegant.
I meant to say may we have a brief, friendly chat? No.
Failed again.
''We request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas.
'' Nooo! You've been safety inspector for two years.
What initiatives have you spearheaded? Uh all of them? I see.
Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
I sure do! Such as? Well, uh I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills because a lot of workers really like candy.
We understand, Homer.
After all, we are from the land of chocolate.
Wow chocolate, half-price! La la la-la-la-la-la Mr.
Simpson.
La-la-la-la-la Mr.
Simpson? Huh? Oh, sorry.
We were talking about chocolate? That was ten minutes ago.
I think I did pretty good in there.
Yeah, those Germans aren't so bad.
Sure, they've made mistakes in the past, but that's why pencils have erasers.
Attention, workers.
We have completed our evaluation.
We regret to announce the following layoffs which I will read in alphabetical order.
Simpson, Homer.
That is all.
Ay, caramba.
! Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair.
And we saved $40 for the family.
We all have to pull together till your father gets a new job.
I made some soap by squeezing soap slivers together.
That's very clever.
Instead of buying comic books, I read them in the store.
You shouldn't do that.
My jump rope broke, but I tied it together.
Good, Lisa.
I didn't take a bath today and may not take one tomorrow.
I want you to take baths, Bart.
Lousy German know-it-alls.
Who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh, what's the matter with this thing? No problems here.
That's right, Burnsie.
Keep your wrist supple.
Throw it, don't aim it.
This is my park.
Get out! It was worth it.
This place has gone to hell.
It's obscene what they did to your office.
You caught me at a bad time.
But my folk guitar class has been canceled.
Would you like to get together for a drink? Would I?! I got to go.
See you at 6:00.
You're going down, my friend.
Yes, sir, Mr.
Burns.
That shouldn't be.
Ach du lieber.
! Raccoons! That's right.
Gather the nectar, my little drones and make the honey-- honey for your children.
Fools! Ready for that drink, sir? Just a second.
Let me introduce you to the gang.
That's Buzz, that's Honey.
And you see that queen? Her name is Smithers.
That's very flattering, but we should go.
Several bees are stinging me.
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.
I'm looking for a Mrs.
O'Problem, first name: Bea.
Uhjust a minute, I'll check.
Uh Bea O'Problem? Bea O'Problem? Come on, guys.
Do I have a Bea O'Problem here? You sure do.
Oh! It's you, isn't it? When I get you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains.
Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern.
I need you to bring your father home.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Wait a minute.
I know that voice.
If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in years.
That's right.
That's my pop.
Oh, little Bart.
We hear all about your monkeyshines.
Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don't even know about.
Am I right? Well, I make some crank phone calls.
Aw, ha-ha, that's great! Ha-ha-ha! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me? Moe, for you, anything.
Look.
! A blue-collar bar.
Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming.
Encore! He's a pip, this one is.
Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned.
Hold your nose, Smithers.
We're going in.
Watch me blend in.
Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my buddy here.
I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile.
Smithers, who is this saucy fellow? Homer Simpson.
Sector sieben-gruben-- I mean, sector 7-G.
Recently terminated.
I lost my job so you could have another $1 00 million! Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue? Yes.
Bad example.
Let me ask you this: Does your money ever hug you when you come home at night? Why, no.
And does it ever say ''I love you''? No, it doesn't.
Nobody loves you Nobody loves you You're old and you're ugly Way to go, Homer! Good heavens, Smithers.
They're not afraid of me anymore.
Hey, Mr.
Burns, did you get that letter I sent? Letter? I don't recall-- That's because I forgot to stamp it! Ah, that kid slays me.
That was no accident.
Let's get out of here.
Na na nah nah Na na nah nah Wa-a-ave Good-bye What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back.
Gott in himmel.
! Who'd have thought a nuclear plant could be such a death trap? It will cost another 1 00 million just to bring it up to code.
Please sell me my plant back.
I'll pay anything.
What a happy coincidence! You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell.
Desperate, eh? Advantage: Burns.
This is my offer.
You'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks.
But this is half of what we paid you.
That's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.
All right, Mr.
Burns, you win.
But beware-- we Germans aren't all smiles und sunshine.
Ooh, the Germans are mad at me.
I'm so scared.
Ooh, the Germans! Stop it.
Stop that.
The Germans are coming after me.
Stop the pretending you are scared game.
They're so big.
Stop it, Mr.
Burns.
Protect me from the Germans! Stop it! Get out! This is my office now! Get out! You too! This is a place of business, not a peewee flophouse! Your orders, sir.
Restore my office, cancel all repairs and rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
Homer Simpson? But why? Smithers, I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer.
He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head.
Whoo-hoo! I got my job back! Shh!

## The Simpsons ## D'oh! ''Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test''? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand? But, Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe.
Okay, let's see.
''Ahoy, mateys.
''If the water turns blue, a baby for you.
''If purple ye see, no baby thar be.
'' Well, what color is it-- blue or purple? Pink.
D'oh! ''If a test should fail to a doctor set sail.
'' I guess I better go see Dr.
Hibbert.
Oh, honey do you really think you're pregnant? I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids.
And I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get.
I'll let you know.
Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor? Is anything wrong? Everything's fine.
Your mother, uh just broke her leg.
I smell a bun in the oven.
Is Mom going to have another baby, Dad? Maybe.
- Whoa! - Hey, all right! Way to go! You're a machine, Homer.
Did you hear that, Maggie? Another baby in the house.
Oh, cool.
We can race 'em.
Sure, for you, a baby's all fun and games.
For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.
Doesn't Mom do that? Yeah, but I hear about it.
Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me? I threw up more than your mother.
It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s.
Those were idealistic days-- The candidacy ofJohn Anderson, the rise of Supertramp.
It was an exciting time to be young.
For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
Homer, you turn the blades too fast.
The golfers are complaining.
Slow down! That's better.
Ah, beautiful.
Keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters.
Yes, sir! I was 2 4 years old with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future.
You're supposed to be listening to my story! I thought it was over.
You had a problem turning blades.
You overcame it.
The feel-good story of the year.
It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans.
We watch an appalling amount ofTV.
Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television.
You lousy, ungrateful can't-keep-their, what-do-you-call-it minds-on-any, uh Okay, girls, you can smoke now.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
It's Homer! I don't know what you see in that ugly meatball.
Uh-huh.
If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy we could get a cat.
It would leave less hair on the couch.
You don't know Homer like I do.
He's sensitive and sweet.
Marge, get your butt out here.
! Mmm.
Homer, do you ever think about the future? You mean like will apes be our masters? No, how you plan to earn a living.
I can't imagine that job of yours is stimulating.
It gives me time to think.
What do you think about? Well, girls.
I mean boys! I mean you.
I think about you too.
Wow, what an ending.
Who would have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father? Well, thank you, Mr.
Blow-The-Picture-For-Me.
Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda.
Oh, Homer.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
I bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
Actually, she was singing about God.
Oh, well, he's always happy.
No, wait, he's always mad.
Someday I'll buy you a real castle.
You don't have to do that.
Whoo, good.
Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking but I think you're pretty sexy.
Really? It must be the Champale talking.
Oh, Homer, what if we get caught? Don't worry.
This castle is impregnable.
Pass the cookie dough.
Dust off your hula skirts, angels.
There's been a murder in Hawaii.
Hawaii, it is, Charlie.
Hello? Oh, hi, Marge.
I need you to drive me to the doctor, Homer.
Why, what's wrong? Well that unforgettable night we joined the castle club.
Oh.
Well, Miss Bouvier we found the reason why you've been throwing up in the morning.
Congratulations.
D'oh! Poor guy.
Perhaps this pamphlet will prove helpful.
''So You've Ruined Your Life.
'' Mmm.
Son, you've got to marry that girl.
Because it's honorable? No! Because you'll never do any better.
You lucky bum.
The fish jumped right in the boat.
All you got to do is whack her with the oar.
Marge, there's something I want to ask you but I'm afraid because if you say ''no'' it'll destroy me and make me a criminal.
I haven't said ''no'' to you lately.
Marge, I-- Damn it, where's that card? What card? I wrote down what I was going to say on a card.
Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.
Is this it? What's it say? ''Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else.
I don't have much to offer you except all my love.
Will you marry me?'' That's the card.
Oh, Homer this is the most beautiful moment of my life.
So, will you marry me? Yes! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, she's going to marry me! In your face, everybody! Whoo-hoo! If the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel? The baby's name will be Kool Moe Dee Simpson.
Ariel.
Kool Moe Dee.
- Ariel.
- Kool Moe Dee.
You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago.
If the baby's a boy what do you think of the name Larry? We can't do that.
All the kids will call him Larry Fairy.
Well, how about Louis? They'll call him Screwy Louie.
- Bob? - Slob.
- Luke? - Puke.
- Marcus? - Mucus.
What about Bart? Let's see.
Bart, cart, dart, e-art-- Nope.
Can't see any problem with that.
Wow.
I'll take that ring.
And how will you be paying for it? I don't know.
Finally, the big day came.
We didn't have much money so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line.
Basic ceremony is 20 bucks.
Here's your license.
Get this punched every time.
The tenth wedding is on the house.
This marriage is gonna last forever.
No matter how many times I hear that it always makes me laugh.
Cletus, do you take Aileen to be your lawful wedded wife? Yup.
Done.
Next.
There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
Marge, I'm sorry.
I wish I could afford a better place.
Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day but you are how I pictured my husband.
- I am? - You may not look like Ted Bessell but you're just as nice.
Ohhh.
We are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino to join-- Homer.
- And-- - Marge.
In holy matrimony.
Beautiful.
Do you, Marjorie Bouvier, take Homer Simpson to be your lawful wedded husband? I do.
Homer, same question, names reversed.
I do.
By the power vested in me by the state gaming commission I pronounce you man and wife.
Here's $1 0 worth of chips.
You may kiss the bride.
Next.
! Mmm.
What a perfect day.
Our first night together as man and wife.
Mmm.
Hey, love birds, keep it down.
Look what I got, Marge.
A baby monitor.
Baby to Marge.
Baby to Marge.
Wah! Wah! Over.
I don't know how we can afford these things on your salary.
Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well.
I heard radiation can make you sterile.
Now you tell me.
We only have two openings so one of you will go home empty-handed.
But it won't be my old frat buddy Lou Collier.
How you doing, you old Alpha Tau? Smithers, you keg-meister, you.
- Uh-huh-huh, hey.
- Uh-huh-huh, hey.
Well, hey, I'm from the Alabama chapter.
Well, I'll be.
Let's get on with the testing.
If I didn't know better, I'd swear he was trying to moon us.
What would you say is your worst quality? I am a workaholic.
I push myself too hard.
It takes me a long time to learn anything.
I'm kind of a goof-off-- That will do.
Stuff starts disappearing-- That's enough.
There's a problem with the reactor.
What do you do? A problem with the reactor?! We're all going to die! Run! Mmm mmm.
Did you get the job? Nah, they wanted someone good.
Story of my life.
Oh, Homey.
Hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking.
Wow.
Kid, I won't let you down.
When you come out of there the first thing you're going to see is a man with a good job.
Yeah.
The doctor.
and when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold.
What a crappy candle.
You've ruined our vacation.
You, gentle sir, are fired.
Oh! Oh, hello, young man.
Good evening, madam.
You have been selected by Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Never-Dull knife edge.
Here.
Shake hands with the Slash-Co.
Handle first, handle first.
Hmm.
I quit! I quit! I thought you said you liked dogs.
Hey! Who wants to get rich today? - Me! Me! - Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first.
Let me assure you that this is not one of those shady pyramid schemes you've been hearing about.
Our model is the trapezoid that guarantees each investor an 800% return within hours of your initial-- - Uh-oh! The cops! ''Fourth notice.
'' ''90 days overdue.
'' ''We break thumbs.
'' Homer, what are we going to do? I don't know.
I don't know.
Repo man.
I'm here for the baby's things.
Crib, mobile, monitor and the lady's ring, I'm afraid.
Oh, dear.
Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
Dear Marge.
By the time you read this, I will be gone.
You deserve all the finest things and although I can give them to you they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog.
Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here.
Shut up with that pen scratching down there.
I will send you every cent I earn for the baby but you will not see me again until I am a man.
That is so sad.
Oh, come on, honey.
You know how it turns out.
After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household.
Can we have a can of frosting for lunch? Okay.
''You will not see me again until I am a man.
'' Oh, Homer Homer! We're all in shock.
I thought he'd two-time you for a while first.
This taco is full of hair.
Uh-huh.
There's your explanation.
Shall we tell Marge? Let her read about it in the society page.
Homer?! Oh.
Marge, listen, we just saw-- Don't be stupid.
Dear Marge, X-X-X-- Homer.
Big shots with their stainless steel lunch boxes.
They get doughnuts! That's right.
All the colors of the rainbow.
Wow.
Marge, what are you doing up? You need rest.
I heard a noise outside, and thought it might be Homer.
Ay! What the hell.
Marge, I've got 2Â½/ words for you.
Gulp 'n' Blow.
Yeah, what do you want? My husband by my side.
You want fries with that? Homer?! Marge?! Homer! Marge! Holy cow, you're as big as a house! Homer, come home with me.
No, Marge, I can't.
I mean, look at me.
I'm a trainee.
They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce.
And I can't buy you a decent wedding ring.
Any ring is fine, as long as it's from you.
Marge pour vous.
Oh! Would you mind if I took it off? The oil is burning my finger.
Oh, sure.
Homer, do you know why I married you? I knocked you up.
No, because I love you.
Come home soon.
That's it.
Come closer.
Ironic, isn't it? The hunter has become the hunted.
Oh, God, Smithers I feel so alive! You the boss? - Yes.
- I'll call Security.
Listen, Mr.
Big Shot if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself I'm your man! Treat me like dirt-- I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream! If you don't like it, I can change! Hold the phone, Smithers.
I like your attitude.
Feisty, yet spineless.
This man failed the aptitude test and got trapped in a closet on his way out.
I don't care.
I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young bootlick named Waylon Smithers.
You mean? Welcome aboard, son.
I got the job.
I got the job! Whoo-hoo! Only in America could I get a job! Who was that young hellcat? Homer Simpson.
Simpson, eh? I'll remember that name.
Marge, Marge! You're a little late.
She's gone to the hospital.
The hospital?! I'll drive you.
Thanks, Mom.
Don't ever call me that.
Where's the baby? Where you left it.
Shut up.
Listen, fat boy-- No, you listen.
This is my wife, and my kid.
I'm paying for this delivery.
If you wanna stay you give me some respect.
Homer, does this mean? Tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician! Good God! Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back.
Doesn't your job start tomorrow? Somebody will cover for me.
Homer, that's Oh! Step aside.
I'll deliver this baby.
Why don't you let me handle it? Oh, a college boy, eh? Homer, let him deliver the baby! Homey, isn't he beautiful? As long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes he's fine by me.
Oh, Bart! Daddy's little angel.
Ah! Why, you little! He did that on purpose! How could he? He's only ten minutes old.
Bart, Lisa, come here for a minute.
You know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have.
As the years went by your mother and I were blessed twice more and not a day goes by we don't thank God for all three of you.
Homer! I'm not pregnant! Yeah! Whoa! Excellent, Marge! Yes!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Oh, ain't that cute? Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of dancing? Whoa.
Ooh.
Oh, yeah.
Can I have money to buy Bart a birthday present? Money.
- Dad, this is $1 1 0.
- Oh.
Sorry.
That's righteous.
Funky See, Funky Do will be back to lip-synch one of their hits right after this.
Hey, kids, why sit in front of the TV when you can be on the radio? We're gonna roll this truckin' convoy Across the U.
S.
A.
Convoy That could be Bart.
Throw away your bulky transmitters and broadcasting towers.
The superstar celebrity microphone lets you hear your voice through any A.
M.
radio.
Hey, good-looking we'll be back to pick you up later.
He's in for some loving.
It's the perfect gift for birthdays, graduations board meetings.
You're fired.
Bart's birthday's coming up.
But order now, supply is limited.
Limited! Do you have any of those microphones left? Yeah, a couple.
Bart's really going to like my birthday present this year.
It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas.
I'll buy his love yet.
Mmm, yeah.
Okay, Sideshow Mel bring out the birthday cake.
Hey, kids while Sideshow Mel mops up let's see the names of our Krusty birthday pals for today.
All right, here comes my name.
Wow.
Best eight bucks I ever spent.
Bart, your grandpa's on the phone.
He wants to wish you a happy birthday.
Isn't that nice? Take a message.
Right now, I'm off to hit 46 local merchants for free birthday goods and services.
I'm here for my free birthday sundae.
Eat it and get out.
Digital audiotape, my butt.
When I was a kid, we had compact discs and I don't recall no one complaining.
Damn right.
Sorry, Rosarita.
I got to get to my birthday party.
Farewell, SeÃ±or Bart.
Hey, good to see you.
Glad you could make it.
Toby, have you lost weight? Uh-oh, here comes trouble.
It's Wally! Hey, Wally, do something funny.
Hey, later, okay? Hey, why don't you go bug your parents? Cool, Larry the Looter.
All right, stick it to the man.
Hey there.
I hear it's your birthday.
How old are you? Well, I'm-- That's great.
Would you like us to sing you a special song? - Hell, no.
- You got it.
Ready, SeÃ±or Beaveratti? I'm a-ready.
And a-one, and a-two You're the birthday You're the birthday You're the birthday boy or girl What the? It's a label maker.
We have one at home.
Before we got it I was always finding Patty's stubble in my leg razor.
Bart, I'll bet you think nothing's going to top that cactus.
Well, check out my present.
Next.
Bart, be polite.
Next, please.
Bart, I've noticed your birthday presents are a poor crop at best.
I hope this turns the tide.
Ooh,just gorgeous.
Now we can be twins.
There's only one beer left, and it's Bart's.
Hey, boy, how's the microphone working? Fine.
Bart! I would love to get a present like that.
Here you go.
Enjoy.
D'oh! This is a great invention.
Watch.
We got a great big convoy Rocking through the night We got a great big convoy Ain't she a beautiful sight? Convoy Quit it, Dad! Hey, good-looking we'll be back for some dinner later.
What did you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion.
What a crappy birthday.
I don't think this is such a bad present.
Maybe you shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does.
Testing.
Testing one-two-three.
Oh, my.
Do I sound like that? Hey, it does work.
I bet you could have a lot of fun with this.
Why don't you go show your father? Mmm, chocolate.
D'oh! Mmm, chocolate.
D'oh! Marge, we need some more vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream.
I'll get some at the store tomorrow, Homer.
Mmm, chocolate.
People of Earth, this is Bartron-- commander of the Martian invasion force.
Your planet is in our hands.
Resistance is useless.
We have captured your president.
He was delicious.
Why, you little-- Oh just promise me you won't play any more practical jokes.
I promise.
Mama.
Mama.
Maggie, you talked! Can you say ''Mama'' again? Sorry, lady.
Show's over.
Oh, Bart.
I dreamed I was married to Corey and we lived on a pony farm and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off.
Oh, brother.
Mrs.
Crabapple, that was uncalled for.
Bravo! Well done, old man.
Hmm.
Rod, Tod, this is God.
How did you get on the radio? What do you mean? I created the universe, stupid kids.
Forgive my brother.
We believe you.
Talk is cheap.
Perhaps a test of thy faith.
Walk through the wall.
I will remove it for you later.
What do you want? I got a job for thee.
Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons' porch.
But those belong to our parents.
Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God? Happy God.
Then quit flapping your lip.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Whoops.
Help! Help! Sounds like trouble a-brewing at the old well! Help me, please.
I fell down the well! I'll get help, laddie.
A little nip of courage.
Out of my way! Look out, you horse's arse! Sucker.
Huh? Hey, what's up? Some poor kid fell down a well.
Yes! My name is Timmy O'Toole.
I just turned ten years old.
Timmy, where are your parents? I have no family.
I tried to enroll in school but Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes.
He's a liar.
The circumference of the well is 34 inches.
So, unfortunately not one member of our police force is slender enough to rescue the boy.
By God, men, you're a bunch of marshmallows.
Why don't you go, Chief? Well, I'm too important.
Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock.
Any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig.
In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions.
Grasping the child firmly in his talons Socrates here will fly him to safety.
Just watch.
I don't think he's coming back.
With this hook and this hunk of chocolate I'll land your boy and I'll clean him for free.
Although we can't reach the boy we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him.
Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole trapped in that well.
Bart, what's wrong with you? Yeah.
Timmy is a real hero.
How do you mean, Dad? Well, he fell down a well and can't get out.
How does that make him a hero? Well, it's more than you did.
Channel 6's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community-- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes-- for a video called ''We're Sending Our Love down the Well.
'' I wanted to do something to help so I called my friend, Sting.
He said ''When do you need me?'' I said, ''Thursday.
'' He said, ''I'm busy.
'' I said, ''Friday?'' He said ''Friday's worse.
'' Then he said, ''How about Saturday?'' I said, ''Fine.
'' True story.
Yeah.
I used to open for Krusty in '69.
In fact, he fired me, as I recall.
Oh, Sting.
But this isn't about show business.
This is about some kid down a hole or something.
We've gotta do what we can.
There's a hole in my heart as deep as a well For that poor little boy who sunk halfway to hell Though we can't get him out we'll do the next best thing And go on TV and sing, sing, sing And we're sending our love down the well All the way down We're sending our love down the well Down that well Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties? We got to pay for promotion, shipping, distribution.
You know, those limos out back aren't free.
Whatever's left, we throw down the well.
Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth.
$6.
00 a bag.
Step to the rear.
Plenty of room in the back.
## The Itchy and Scratchy Show ## Hmm? Hmm? Ah.
Drop that microphone.
Drop it, boy! This is a special report from Channel 6 News.
Disturbing news from the old well where Timmy O'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse.
It's very simple, Kent.
The child is reverting to a feral or wolf-like state.
Here's an artist's conception.
Bart.
Ahem.
I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock.
Good night, everybody.
The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness of the entire community.
When they find out you've been fooling them they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors.
And how are they going to find out? The police will catch you.
The police couldn't catch a cold.
Maybe not, but you're stupid enough to have left a ''Bart Simpson'' label on that radio.
D'oh! ''and Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball with eight satin petticoats each more delicate than the last.
'' I think he's asleep.
Want a cup of coffee? Okay.
Brave little guy.
Hey.
Almost tripped over this thing.
Ugh! What did I do to deserve this? Help! I fell down the well.
Tell us something we don't know.
No, my name is Bart Simpson.
What are you doing down there? Look, I'll level with you.
There is no Timmy O'Toole.
It was just a prank I was playing on everybody.
Well, you sure fooled us, kid.
Hey, I got an idea for a prank.
Let's go home and go to sleep.
Good one, Eddie.
Ha, ha.
Great joke, guys.
Guys? Your son is trapped down the well.
You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Yes, that's pretty much the feeling down at the station.
Don't worry, son.
Just 'cause you're trapped doesn't mean you can't live a full life.
I brought you your Krusty doll.
Ow! Knock it off, you bald boob! Don't make me come down there! Like to see you fit.
Why, you little! - Put a man on him.
I like the other boy.
So polite.
What are you doing to save my baby boy? We've located a piece of machinery in Louisiana that could pop him out lickety-split.
Why don't you get it? We've got a budget problem.
Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well.
Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo.
You're telling me the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well? They would have for Timmy, but your son he played us all for saps.
Mmm.
We've all been the victims of a cruel hoax perpetrated by a ten-year-old hooligan.
The time has come for finger-pointing and most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
It's not our fault.
We didn't want the boy.
He was an accident.
Homer! Could you edit that last part? Mr.
Simpson, we're live.
D'oh! One plus one plus three is five Little Bart Simpson's buried alive He's so neat He's so sweet Now the rats have Bart to eat Hey, stop that! Oh.
Sorry, Lisa.
How many days until Bart croaks? One, two, three, four And our new number one hit ''I Do Believe We're Naked'' by Funky See, Funky Do replaces ''We're Sending Our Love down the Well,'' which plunges all the way down to number 97.
Ever since I called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I have taken heat so I am flip-flopping.
I say let him stay down there.
Yeah, Shutton here.
Now, that's a story.
Bart, honey, I made you an extra warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well.
Mom, it's too big.
You'll grow into it.
Homer! I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years.
Now I'm paying the price but there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do-- smoke a cigarette use a fake I.
D.
shave a swear word in my hair-- That's all I can stands.
I can't stands no more.
I'm going to get you out of there myself.
Now, why didn't I think of that? Agnes, we've got work to do.
This is Kent Brockman with a special bulletin.
The Lincoln squirrel has been assassinated.
We'll stay with the story all night, if we have to.
What's going on? It's an old-fashioned hole digging.
By gar, it's been a while.
The canary.
Gas! Out of the hole! Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes.
Back in the hole! Sting, you look tired.
Maybe you should take a rest.
Not while one of my fans needs me.
Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play your albums.
Shh! Marge, he's a good digger.
Uhh! Sting! Mom! Dad! Bart, I've missed you so much.
Man, I was so scared.
Don't worry, son.
They're going to make sure no one ever falls down this well again.
That should do it.
Shh!

Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
Well, bye-bye belt.
Homer, all those fatty deep-fried, heavily-salted snacks can't be good for your heart.
My heart is just fine.
A little beer will put out that fire.
Now with the specs for today's games the man who's right Smooth Jimmy Apollo.
Our first game today, Denver and New England is too close to call.
Oh But if you're the compulsive type who just has to bet Well, I don't know.
Mmm Denver! Woo-whoo! Denver! Yeah! Moe's Tavern where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
Moe, I'd like to bet $20 on Denver.
I think I can provide that service.
Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book? Sure thing, Moe.
I was using it as a coaster.
$20 on Denver.
Pleasure doing business H.
S.
All right, Denver, justify my love.
At the end of 1 3 seconds it's New England seven, Denver nothing.
D'oh! Look, Dad.
I made an apartment for my Malibu Stacy doll.
This is a kitchen.
This is where she prints her feminist newsletter.
Dad, you're not listening to me! Lousy, stupid Denver.
Mmm! Oh, look at that, a shoe box house.
Lisa, you're so clever.
Why isn't Dad interested in anything I do? Do you ever take an interest in anything he does? No Well, we used to have burping contests but I outgrew it.
If you want to get closer to him maybe you should bridge the gap.
I do it all the time.
I pretend I'm interested in power tools going to silly car-chase movies and things I'll tell you when you're older.
Do you understand? I think so.
- Bart! - What? Oh, look at that.
Why did you do that? Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together? Uh okay.
Just don't say anything, and sit down over there.
Over.
Over.
Over.
Over.
Lisa, I can't hear the announcer.
He said Denver fumbled.
D'oh! See you in hell, soldier boy.
- Bart? - Yeah, Mom? While your father and Lisa watch the game it might be fun if we went clothes shopping.
Mom, I'd love to, but I don't need new clothes.
Oh, really? Even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes, it's not Folks, when you're right you're wrong 48% of the time.
Why didn't you say that before?! Okay, you're off the hook.
Any thoughts on Miami-Cincinnati? I certainly do, Bret.
I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's 'Lock of the Week.
' Ooh, that's a big lock.
I just don't trust that guy.
In the Cincinnati-Miami game I declare Cincinnati my 'Shoe-in of the Week.
' They both make a good case.
After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye the Gamble-Tron 2000 says the winner is Cincinnati by 200 points?! Why, you worthless hunk of junk! - You want this, don't you? - Yeah! You need the winners, and I know them.
So call me now.
$5 for the first minute, $2 for additional minutes.
You have reached the Coach's Hot Line.
line.
Lay it on me, Coach.
In the game of Mi-am-i Mm-hmm.
versus Cin Cincinnati.
- cin - Cincinnati.
- na - Cincinnati.
- ti - Come on! Don't you realize this is costing me money? we must consider many things.
The wind D'oh, not the wind! is blowing out of the west at five Miles per hour.
knots.
This is ridiculous! Lisa, who do you think will win-- the Bengals or the Dolphins? I don't know.
The Dolphins? Good, good.
Moe, $50 on the Miami Dolphins.
Homer, I got a call on the other line.
It's me, Mr.
K.
What will it be? Put me down for $7 00 on the Rams.
Put Sideshow down for two grand.
Mom, I'm tired.
I want to go home.
Can't I just lie down for a minute? Bart, I think you'd look very sharp in this shirt.
Fine.
Get it.
Let's go.
No, no, no.
You have to try it on.
Ooh, this one's 50% off.
That's because people who wear them get beaten up.
Well, anyone who would do that isn't your friend.
This looks good and this one is very, very cute and these Oh, look, little bow ties! And don't make that face at me.
How did you know? Touchdown, Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! All right, Dolphins! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Uh-oh.
Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him $50 if the Dolphins won.
You made a bet? I wouldn't call it a bet.
It's a little thing daddies do to make football more exciting.
What could be more exciting than the savage ballet of pro football? Well, you know.
You like ice cream, don't you? Don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream, chopped nuts and those crumbled-up cookie things they mash up? Mmm crumbled-up cookie things.
So gambling makes a good thing even better? That's right! My God it's like there's some kind of bond between us.
Hmm? Mm-hmm.
We've got a troublemaker in booth eight.
There's a code red in booth three.
My God! Those aren't the socks she came in with.
Let's move.
- Bart? - In here, Mom.
Don't open You could use some new underwear too.
Look at that stupid kid! - Three! - Three! - Two! - Two! - One! - One! And the final from Riverfront Stadium: Miami 2 4, Cincinnati 1 0.
- Yeah! - Yeah! Mom sure will be happy you won $50.
You'd think that but your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong even though they say it's okay in the Bible.
Really? Where? Uh somewhere in the back.
The point is, we had a great time today.
To keep it that way let's not tell your mother about our little wager, okay? Okay, Dad.
Did you two have fun? You bet.
We had fun too.
Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends.
Ooh You got to come out sometime, Simpson.
- Good night, Dad.
I had a nice time today.
- Me too, honey.
Can I watch football with you again next Sunday? Sure.
It gets rid of the unpleasant aftertaste of church.
See how good things happen if you make a little effort? Point well taken.
Could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight, and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs.
This team is fired up.
- All right! - He'll lose.
What? Didn't you hear what he said? The fear in his eyes, the quiver in his voice.
He's a little boy lost in a game of men.
Should we bet against them? I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Moe, $23 on New York.
Start spreading the news.
It's New York over Philadelphia, 3 5 to 1 0.
- Yay! - Yay! Dad, I hate to break the mood but I'm getting nauseous.
Oh, sorry.
So, who do you like in the afternoon games? The 49ers because they're pure of heart Seattle because they got something to prove and the Raiders because they cheat.
In an extremely suspicious play the Raiders win! Three for three! Hey, the new sign's really working.
It's been a madhouse, Lisa.
Let's see football football Homoeroticism in Oddball Canadian Rules Phyllis George in Oh, doctor, what a finish! The final score-- Atlanta 1 7, Houston 1 3.
The lowly Falcons are flying high.
Who would have thunk it? My daughter, that's who.
Yeah, me.
You pick the winner every time.
You must have some kind of special gift.
It doesn't take a genius to realize Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings the week after scoring three touchdowns in a game.
My little girl says the cutest things.
Dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.
Not Sunday-- Daddy-Daughter Day.
The usual, Moe-- a beer and a wad of bills! Okay you lucky moron.
Here you go, Homer, $1 3 5.
I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet.
Now it's the smell of victory.
Oh, shut up.
Look at these prices! We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
Tut-tut, only the best for my family.
I wonder where you're getting the money.
Can't a man do something nice for his loved ones? I guess so.
Hello, I'm Marco, I'll be your waiter.
I'm Homer, I'll be your customer.
Never heard that one before.
Would you care to select the wine? I'll do the honors.
No, no, no, no.
My God! What passes for a wine list these days? Just bring us your freshest bottle of wine.
Chop, chop.
Charming lad.
Oh, violin guy.
What's your favorite song, Lisa? ''The Broken Neck Blues.
'' Play on.
It is the play-offs.
It's five below.
One fan's wearing a G-string and the team colors on his body.
Maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating.
That is a real fan.
It's Daddy-Daughter Day and Daddy needs daughter's picks.
The Chiefs are my five star, silver bullet special.
With your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago.
You call Moe.
Moe, this is L.
S.
calling for H.
S.
Just bet, Lisa.
You lucky son of a Want to go bowling Sunday? Are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl.
How about the Sunday after that? Ma's coming in from Norway but what the hell.
When the doctor said I didn't have worms anymore, that was the happiest day of my life.
Thank you, Ralph, very graphic.
Lisa Simpson, would you like to read your essay? The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago when the Saints-- four and a half point favorites only up by three-- kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second to cover the spread.
Dear God! You must have bought me every Malibu Stacy accessory.
Not quite.
They were out of Malibu Stacy lunar rovers.
Ooh, perfume! '' Meryl Streep's Versatility.
'' I know you're going to like your present.
Shut up! Shut up! Kiss my butt! Go to hell! Dad, I promise I will never get tired of this.
Those were very thoughtful presents but you have to tell me where you got the money.
You have to promise you won't get mad.
I promise I will.
I always do when you make me promise I won't.
Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football.
Homer! You promised you wouldn't get mad.
I promised I would! She's eight years old! Marge, she's got a gift.
Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent? Gambling is illegal.
Only in 48 states.
Besides, it's a victimless crime.
The only victim is Moe and it's brought Lisa and me together.
I just don't know.
What's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep and I got that foot massager I've always wanted.
Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.
You know, Dad we've been watching a lot ofTV lately.
Maybe the Sunday after the Super Bowl we could climb Mt.
Springfield.
The fires in the tire yards make beautiful sunsets.
Next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney.
What about Daddy-Daughter Day?! The new football season is only seven months away.
So that's it.
You just wanted me to help you gamble.
You never wanted to be with me at all.
You're a very selfish man.
Go to hell! Go to hell! Hey, once again, great present, Dad.
Uh uh My third husband bought me this.
Give me some chips for it.
Are you sure? Don't tell me what to do.
I've been gambling since I was eight and hocking jewelry since I was 1 2.
Give me chips.
Look around you, Malibu Stacy.
All this was bought with dirty money.
Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen-injection clinic.
Back into the box.
It may not be pretty but damn it, it's honest.
I, Lisa Simpson am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacy accessories! Ahh! Look, I bought you a Malibu Stacy chinchilla coat.
Huh? You've come to buy my forgiveness.
Sorry, Homer.
Lisa, honey, I'm sorry but I really had a good time watching football with you and I think you had a good time with me.
Yeah, I did.
We can still watch the Super Bowl together can't we? Well, I would like to see what the fuss is about.
It's a date.
So do you think the Redskins will beat the spread? Put me down.
I'll tell you who's going to win but it will just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.
Okay.
I think Washington is a mortal lock.
Washington! Whoo-hoo! However What however? However what? However, I may also be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose.
In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo.
Do me a favor.
Complete this sentence: Daddy should bet all his money on I don't know.
D'oh! If I still love you Washington.
If I don't, Buffalo.
Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it.
We're live from the Hubert H.
Humphrey Metrodome and Super Bowl 26.
Today we're going to be seen by people in 1 50 countries all over the world including our newest affiliate, W-Gimel-Aleph-Nun in Tel Aviv.
Stupid! Formidable.
Every note is a dagger in my heart.
I got to get out of here.
Moe's Tavern home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular.
Ohh! Baloney.
Bread! Got you down for 40 bucks.
Good luck, Your Eminence.
You can't take more of my money.
I'm out of the bookie business.
But Moe, you've been taking bets all Barney, have a free beer.
Wow! Don't worry, I'm not betting.
What? - Give me that.
- Aw.
I had the greatest gift of all-- a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it.
We're two hours and 45 minutes through the pregame show.
Our guest is Troy McClure whose new sitcom premiers tonight right after the game! Thanks, Bret.
My new show's called Handle With Care.
I playJack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal.
The original odd couple.
I fell in love with the script, Bret and my recent trouble with the I RS sealed the deal.
That's great, Troy.
Ooh! Looks like we're almost ready for the kickoff.
Washington kicks.
Oh, it's a bad kick, way too short.
Buffalo starts in excellent position.
Buffalo's going to win.
Lisa hates me.
What did you bet? My daughter.
What a gambler.
And with the score at the half Buffalo 1 4, Washington 7 it's time for the never-tedious Super Bowl halftime show.
People of Earth, we've come ten billion light-years to bring you this halftime message of peace.
Oh, this sucks.
Come on, snipers, where are you? Bart, who's winning? You-Hate-Dad by a touchdown.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Yay!! Announcer: for halfback Dan Beerdorf.
Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl.
They wanted it more.
Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins your daughter loves you? Not Duff Dry, Washington.
Okay, okay, they're both great teams.
- Yay! - Yay! Huh? Touchdown, Redskins.
All right, we're back in business.
Well, I'm glad some people could resist the lures of the big game.
I forgot the game! It all comes down to this one play.
If Washington scores, happy fans will be looting and turning over cars in our nation's capital tonight.
Please, please, please.
Touchdown! It is done.
The Washington Redskins win Super Bowl 26! You love Dad.
I suspected as much.
Yes! She loves me, she loves me.
Why are you so happy? You didn't win money.
Money comes and goes, but my daughter and I can go on for eight more years! Come on, Dad! It's beautiful.
Isn't it, though? After I catch my breath can we go home?

## The Simpsons ## D'oh! I am not cleaning that.
Mmm, who am I kidding? Now, Maggie when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want.
Extra mustard for Bart's sliced diagonally.
Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust.
Double bologna for Homer - Mom-- - Mom-- Can you sign my-- Where's my lucky red cap? I hate those pimento things-- I split my pants again.
Ooh! Can I have two sandwiches? I got a test today-- I can't eat those-- One at a time! One at a time! - Double bologna! - No pimentos! - Don't forget to make it-- - Mom, where's my-- That's enough! There you go, Lisa-- no pimentos.
Bart, your hat's behind the toilet.
Homer, I'll sew your pants, but I'm out of bologna.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thanks, Mom.
D'oh! Videos to return grocery list, flea dip for the cat dry cleaning-- I think that's everything.
Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole.
I'm running late.
Can't you use a ball at the alley? Ohh, alley balls? All right.
Don't whine.
Just put it in my left hand.
Kids, hurry up or you're going to miss your bus.
- No way.
- Never happen.
Well, I'll be damned.
Bart's making faces at me.
It's a nervous twitch, and I'm sensitive about it if you don't mind.
Get out! Fruit leather Tree Fresh imitation orange drink Krusty brand duck sausage pizza-- You've got the wrong Nick's.
You want Nick's on the other side of town.
I don't know what Nicky's telling you.
I haven't flushed a ball in years.
Oh, this miserable stress headache.
Feels like there's a rat in my brain! It's time for another Bill and Marty classic crank call.
Hello, Mr.
Justin Sherman? Yes.
Your wife is dead.
Oh, God, no! That's right.
She just walked through a plate glass window.
There's blood everywhere.
I just talked to her.
Bart's making faces.
Where's my red cap? Alley balls? Your wife is dead.
I haven't flushed a ball in years.
Noooo!! Lady, this better be good.
This is Arnie Pie with Arnie in the Sky.
We've got big problems on the Springfield Memorial Bridge.
Traffic going waaay back in both directions.
And look out at 1 4th and Elm.
I just dropped my bagel.
She's locked in the car and refuses to move.
Did you flash your lights? Yes.
Well, I'm fresh out of ideas.
All right! A chance to catch some rays.
Come on! Come on! I got a body in the trunk.
Mr.
Genie, stop fiddling with the buttons.
Oh! You've gotten chocolate all over everything.
This is Kent Brockman reporting from Arnie Pie's traffic 'copter but this is no mere traffic report.
Hey! Face the facts.
An overworked and underappreciated housewife has parked on the bridge, refusing to budge.
This reporter will be lowered in the sky harness for an exclusive interview.
Huh? Ow! Hey! Ow! Sweetheart, what's the matter? Not getting enough of the good stuff? D'oh! Let me through.
I'm her husband.
That explains a lot.
Try to talk her out of there but don't put your lips on it.
Hello.
Hello! Is this thing on? Hello?! Homer, is that you? What should I say? How about, ''Yes, it's me''? Yes, it's me.
Tell her you love her.
I love you very much.
And, uh later tonight, I think you and I should, uh snuggle? Ha, ha! Uh, why don't you just wrap it up? I can tell something's bothering you but if you come out of that car I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better.
Please, honey? Okay.
Cuff her, boys! Off the record, ma'am all the gals on the force knew just how you felt.
That's nice.
Could you loosen my cuffs? No.
Don't worry.
She'll be cracking rocks by the end of the week.
You glorified night watchman let her go! But she broke the law.
Thanks for the civics lesson.
If Marge Simpson goes to jail I can kiss the chick vote good-bye and if I go down, you're breaking my fall! Quimby, don't write checks your butt can't cash.
Hear me, Wiggum, you bite me, I'll bite back.
You talk the talk, Quimby, but do you walk the walk? I hereby declare today to be Marge Simpson day in the city of Springfield.
They're like seals-- toss 'em a fish and watch 'em slap their fins together.
Well, all's well that ends well.
Good night, Marge.
Many years ago the Spanish explorers discovered their piece of heaven nestled in the Springfield Mountains.
They called it Rancho Relaxo and so do we.
Today, it's Springfield's only two-star health spa.
Swim, play tennis or just sit and stare at the walls.
At Rancho Relaxo, you're the boss.
Remember, you can't spell Relaxo without relax.
Homer? - Homer! - What? I need a vacation.
What?! But, Marge, we just had a vacation.
Remember Mystic Caverns? I need to unwind.
I know you do, Marge but you know what our vacations are like.
Those three monsters in the backseat-- ''Are we there yet? Are we there yet?'' And I'm no day at the beach either.
'' Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?'' No, I mean a vacation by myself.
What?! You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change.
No, Homie, no.
I still love you.
A lot of couples take separate vacations.
Well, okay but you have to swear you're coming back.
I swear.
All right, then.
Thanks for taking the children while I'm away.
Don't worry yourself.
We've got six months of maternity leave we'll never use anyway.
Homer, bring Maggie out.
Wish I'd thought of that.
She's starting to give.
Homer, if Maggie doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.
Are you sure that's wise? He'll probably trade her for a beer and a nudie magazine.
For your information, I can take care of my-- See? Got her on the first bounce.
All aboard for Shelbyville, Badwater Cattle Skull Testing Grounds, and Rancho Relaxo.
Good-bye, Homie.
Good-bye? Where's my clean underwear? Check the dryer.
How often should I change Maggie? Whenever she needs it.
Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker? Don't! Restful, easy listening.
Coming up next a super-set of songs about clouds.
Hmm? Hello, Maggie.
Sorry, honey.
Mommy went crazy and went far, far away so it's going to be just you and me for a while.
Just you and me.
You haven't touched your tongue sandwiches.
Are you thirsty? We've got Clamato, Mr.
Pibb, and soy milk.
That's all right.
I think I'll just hit the hay.
It's 1 2:30 in the afternoon.
I'm aware of the time.
Lisa, you'll sleep in my bed.
Bart, you'll sleep with Aunt Patty.
- In your bed? - Uh-huh.
And I should warn you I'm told I snore.
Ooh, Divorce Court is on in 1 5 minutes! I'm scared, Lisa.
You think you know fear? Well, I've seen them naked.
Oh, hello and welcome to Rancho Relaxo.
I'm Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such films as Today We Kill, Tomorrow We Die, and Gladys, the Groovy Mule.
But today you'll see me in my greatest role-- your video tour guide to Rancho Relaxo.
Our tour starts in your own room where Relaxo-vision offers you the latest Hollywood hits and after midnight the finest '' R'' rated movies Europe has to offer.
Ooh-la-la! Today's selections are: Chef Roderigo, what are you up to? Taste for yourself, Troy.
Mm-mm-mmm! That can't be good for me.
It tastes too good.
That's where you're wrong.
This whole pot is only 1 4 calories.
Oh, Gregory where have you been all my life? Feeling tense? Uh-huh.
Then just push nine on your phone then the pound sign, then 4-8-3.
We'll do the rest.
Come on, Maggie.
Nummy-nummy-num.
Mmm-mm! Mmm.
Strained peas.

Hi, Barney.
Thanks for keeping me company.
No problem.
Well, well.
If it isn't little Bart.
Remember your Uncle Barney? Hey, Homer, let me hold him.
All right, but just be careful.
Whoa! Someone smells stinky.
Oh, it's me.
Bart you shouldn't be looking through other people's things.
Find anything good? I said it before, and I'll say it again.
Ay, caramba.

Heh, heh, heh.
Maggie? Maggie? Maggie?! Oh hoo Maggie! Oh, man.
You want a bad night? Try sleeping on one of these.
I've lost a baby.
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
Don't worry.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make you an omelet.
Just help me look.
Are you sure? I make them with two kinds of cheese.
Homer, I think I've got her.
Come on! Barney, you'll pull her arm off!.
The sooner I get her out the sooner we can have omelets.
Hmm, so, what's the verdict? Oh, dear God.
I can't even put a bag over my head.
Yes, you can.
I'd like the Department of Missing Babies.
Please hold.
Hmm, I guess I've done everything.
By now you've seen what Rancho Relaxo has to offer but remember, we can't tell you how to have a good time.
You have to tell us.
Oh.
As I said to Delores Montenegro in Calling All Quakers '' Have it your way, baby.
'' Hello, room service? This is Marge Simpson.
I'd like a hot fudge sundae with whipped cream and some chocolate chip cheesecake and a bottle of tequila.

Okay, Louise.
What do you want? I came to see the kids.
Wait here and don't steal any light bulbs.
Hmm - Dad! - Dad! Hey, kids.
You haven't seen Maggie around, have you? - Hmm-mm.
- Hmm-mm.
Oh! Well, I got to go.
Come on, kids.
It's time to rub Aunt Patty's feet.
Hello, gov'nor.
Lube job while you wait? Don't touch me.
Yello.
Hi, Homie.
I feel much better.
Listen, Marge uh how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away? Homer, that's awful.
Oh.
Well, I got good news.
The dog didn't run away.
Well, good.
I'm coming home, honey.
You can pick me up in an hour and bring the kids.
Bye.
D'oh! Please, don't jump.
I know you're going through some tough times but you have your whole life ahead of you.
Well, Marge Maggie was very young.
It's not like we got so attached to her.
No.
Marge, isn't life funny? One day, they're babies the next thing you know, they're off on their own.
Did you report a lost baby? Yes.
Describe her.
Uh, she's small she's a girl-- Bingo! Oh, Maggie! Not so fast.
You're wanted on three counts of criminal neglect.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Shucks.
Just don't do it again, you big lug.
You're not going anywhere.
Hi! Did you miss me? Never leave again! Never leave again! Never leave again.
I missed you too.
From now on, I hope you'll help me out.
You got it, sweetheart.
You have enough blanket? Well, I could use a little more.
And sometimes, I want a little time to myself and I expect you-- Mom I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say you have nothing to worry about.
Now, let's just try and get a little shut-eye.
Shh!

## The Simpsons ## D'oh! Hey, what gives? You said you wanted a world without zinc,Jimmy.
Well, now your car has no battery.
I'm supposed to pick Betty up.
I better give her a call.
Sorry,Jimmy.
Without zinc for the rotary mechanism there are no telephones.
Dear God.
What have I done? Think again,Jimmy.
The firing pin in your gun was made of yup zinc.
Come back, zinc.
Come back.
Come back.
Zinc, come back.
Zinc! Zinc, zinc! What? Oh, it was all a dream.
Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones car batteries, handguns, and many things made of zinc.
Gross! He's picking his nose.
Hmph! If anyone wants to learn more about zinc they're welcome to stay.
We can talk about anything.
I'll do your homework for you.

People? All right.
You know, I can wait just as long as you.
Knock it off!.
Now, boys and girls let's welcome our very special guest Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King Yo-Yo Company.
Kids, this is a yo-yo.
Kind of dull, huh? Not much competition for a video game or is it? Presenting the Twirl King champions! Mr.
Amazing! Sparkle! She's beautiful.
Zero Gravity! The Cobra! These guys must be millionaires.
I'll bet they get all kinds of girls.
I question the value of this assembly.
It will be a pleasant memory when they're pumping gas for a living.
Now, for our next stunt, what do you say we get your principal up here? Ooh careful now.
That one grazed my ear.
Don't move.
You could really get hurt.
Oh.
How much do those cost? I don't care.
Wow! Thanks, Sparkle.
Wait.
This isn't you.
That's the old Sparkle.
Get your worthless butts in the van.
We got three more schools.
Let's go, go, go! That's your trick? No.
Here's my trick.
Hoowah! Whoa! Whoa! Thank you.
Marge, come here.
Can you believe it? Soon, I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
Donald Trump? No.
Arnold Palmer? No.
Bill Cosby? No.
D'oh! ''After two months at sea the Pilgrims were running out of food and water.
'' Did they have yo-yos? No, they did not have yo-yos.
''When they landed they were greeted by the Wompanog Indians.
'' Did the Indians have yo-yos? No, they did not have yo-yos! I am sick and tired of talking about yo-yos.
I will not accept any book reports science projects, dioramas or anything else on yo-yos.
Am I making myself clear? Yo.
Hey, Bart got any new tricks for us today? Just one.
A little something I call ''Plucking the Pickle.
'' I build up a little steam, and I didn't do it.
Don't worry about your wee fish, lass.
They're going to a better place.
That's one month's detention.
Mrs.
Krabappel, we're all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles but life goes on.
So, if I could have my yo-yo back If you were me would you give back the yo-yo? Here you go Just kidding.
Here you go Just kidding.
Well, would you? Absolutely.
P-hih! What's eating you, woman? Your ad said you wanted a man.
You got yourself a hummm-dinger.
I guess I expected something different from your photo.
Just because there's a little snow on the roof I forget how the rest of that goes.
One month's detention.
She'll pay for this.
Yup, there's your problem.
Someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here.
Edna, happy hour in the teachers' lounge.
Just a sec.
Hmm.
Huh? ''One plus one equals two?'' ''Write Edna K.
Box 402.
'' Hmm.
Dear Edna I never answered a personal ad before but I found yours irresistible.
My name is Woodrow.
I like holding hands and dinner by candlelight and oh,yes, I really hate yo-yos.
Oh, Woodrow! Maybe we should let the dog in.
Marge, dogs love the outdoors.
I think he needs a doghouse.
What can you do? I bet we could buy a nice doghouse for $50.
Marge, you're a tool of the doghouse makers.
I am not.
Yes, you are.
You've been brainwashed by all those doghouse commercials on TV.
I know.
I'll build him a doghouse.
Oh, I don't know.
Don't worry.
I drew up a little blueprint.
Let me walk you through it.
This is a door.
He goes through that.
This is a roof.
And this happy character here is the sun.
He shines down on the house.
How was detention today? Oh, not bad.
I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer.
Yes! ''Dear Woodrow,you're not like the other men I've met.
'' I'm the 28th president of the United States.
''I've had some bad experiences with these ads.
I'd like to learn more about you, so write soon.
Here's a photo that will get your pencil moving.
'' You've got a date with the Xerox machine.
Stupid lumber.
Damn it! D'oh! I-- Oh, the hell with this! A fellow came in asking for change for a dollar.
I gave him three quarters by mistake.
Took me the whole afternoon to find him.
Todd, would you like mixed vegetables? Hell no.
What did you say? I don't want any damn vegetables.
All right.
No Bible stories for you tonight.
Weren't you a little hard on him? Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me.
Ned Flanders is on the phone.
Oh, if this is about that stupid quarter again, I-- Hello, Ned.
Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy.
Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his damn vegetables.
You know kids and vegetables.
Was it asparagus? No, no, Reverend.
The point is he said a bad word.
Oh.
Oh, right.
Well, kids usually pick these things up from someplace.
Find out who's doing it, and direct them to the Bible.
Where in the Bible? Uh page 900.
But, Reverend Damn Flanders.
Hey, Lise, a moment of your time.
Yeah? Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my ''A'' material.
Ooh, could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about? Is it Teri? No.
Sheri? No! That girl with the lazy eye? No.
That exchange student Mix!pa? No! It's not for me.
It's homework.
Sure it is.
Hey, Bart, let's do some homework.
Golly, Sergeant Carter, I can't fix yourjeep but maybe this will make it up to you.
[ Deep Baritone .]
## Galveston, oh, Galveston ## Is this all he watches? He used to watch Davy and Goliath but he thought the idea of a talking dog was blasphemous.
Mom, did you save Dad's love letters? Of course I saved them.
Well, actually, there's only one and it's more of a love postcard from some brewery he visited.
''Maybe it's the beer talking but you've got a butt that won't quit.
They got these big, chewy pretzels here '' ''Five dollars?.
! Get outta here.
'' Wow, a side of Dad I've never seen! Penny for your thoughts, Miss K.
I was just thinking You wouldn't be interested.
Try me.
It helps to talk.
Well, I was just wishing I could meet a man who likes the way I look first thing in the morning.
- Laughs at my jokes.
- Uh-huh.
- Can fix my car.
- Oh, yeah.
''Dear Edna,your photo took my breath away.
Truly,yours is a butt that won't quit.
Yesterday morning I put your picture up in my garage to inspire me while I gapped my spark plugs.
'' At last, we've built the mission.
Finally, the villagers have a place to pray.
Bringing in the sheaves Bringing in the sheaves We shall come rejoicing Well, he's not getting it from his brother that's for darn sure.
Damn crappy nails.
! Super glue, my butt.
! D'oh! You bas.
.
! Hit it.
.
! Shot.
.
! D'oh! Homer? What is it, Flanders? I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
If it's about your camcorder, I lost it, okay? No, I came to talk to you about your potty mouth.
What the hell are you talking about? All of us pull a few boners now and then-- Go off half-cocked, make asses of ourselves.
I don't want to be hard on you but I wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys.
Oh, come on now, Flanders.
I don't complain about your moustache.
What's wrong with my moustache? Uh, it makes you look like you got something to hide.
What? People are talking.
Lots of people.
Okay, mister you've got a deal.
I'll shave off the soup-strainer if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho.
Aye, aye Admiral Butthead.
We now return to Two for Tunisia on Colorization Theater.
Ah, my love.
A million poets could try for a million years and still describe but three-eighths of your beauty.
Whoa, slow down, Frenchy.
This stuff is gold.
''A million poets working for a million years'' You're so lucky.
When are you going to meet him? First, I ask him to send a photo.
If he's got everything where it should be I'm reeling him in.
Strap on your skates, Gordie.
You're going in.
Hey, Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much.
Marge, you're not laughing.
Well, maybe he's right.
Well, what a surprise.
Marge sticks up for Flanders.
Can we have a conversation where you don't bring up your hero Ned Flanders? Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders.
Maybe I do curse a little but that's the way God made me, and I'm too old to stop now.
No, you're not.
After the navy, my father used to curse a blue streak.
It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer so my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen.
Every time he said a bad word he put in a quarter.
Well, Marge self-improvement has always been a passion of mine.
Bring on the swear jar.
Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with a hammer? Yes, Homer.
If I catch fire? No, Homer.
If I see something weird? Yes, Homer.
What about when we snuggle? Hmm That's okay.
''Dear Woodrow, it's time for us to meet.
Why don't we go out to dinner? After, we'll go to my apartment for some home cookin'.
'' Huh? Ay, caramba.
! ''Hungrily yours, Edna.
'' Well, she's dangled on the line long enough.
It's time to boat this bass.
''When I read your letters, I feel as if you are right here watching me.
'' Bart! Eyes down.
Yes, ma'am.
''Every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles.
Join me at the Gilded Truffle Saturday at 8::00.
Perhaps later we will smooch up a storm.
Sexily yours, Woody.
'' Huh? Oh, I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Homer, that was a 20.
Da.
.
! Oh, you son.
.
! Homer, I owe you one, buddy.
No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster than a lady cast me in a commercial.
These checks keep coming-- It's criminal.
You dirty bast.
.
! What do you think, Lisa? How's the dog supposed to get in? Well, he just goes Ohh! Oh, Woodrow, how could you stand me up? Mrs.
K.
, you don't need him.
There are plenty of good men around.
Name one.
What's wrong with Principal Skinner? Seymour? Hmph.
Let's just say his mommy won't let him out to play.
What about Coach Fortner? Glug, glug, glug, glug Wow.
What about groundskeeper Willy? Ugh! I won't even tell you what that guy's into.
Bart, you are the closest thing to a man in my life and that's so depressing I think I'm to cry.
Aah.
.
! Oh, fudge That's broken.
Fiddle-dee-dee.
That will require a tetanus shot.
I'm not going to swear but I am going to kick this doghouse down! Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills but we bought you a new doghouse.
With what money? There was plenty in the swear jar and inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.
Maggie.
Oh, cute.
No, behind her.
Beer! How did you know? Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie? There's Maggie! Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule but I need help with my love life.
Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart.
I knew it! Who's your girlfriend? Mrs.
Krabappel.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Bart, this is your teacher? I'll start going to parents' night.
Homer! You did a cruel thing.
Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.
No, that would humiliate her.
I thought that's what you wanted to hear.
Let's write her another letter that says good-bye, but let's her feel loved.
Step aside, everyone.
Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
''Dear baby, Welcome to Dumpville.
Population: You.
'' We'll all help.
''Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea my heart is with you.
'' That sucks.
How about ''Crocodiles bit off my face''? That's disgusting, and besides when a woman loves a man, that wouldn't matter.
I may hold you to that, Marge.
''I cannot see you for the next five years for I will be farming the ocean floor.
'' ''I must finish this letter quickly for I have only four minutes to live.
'' Three simple worlds: ''I am gay.
'' Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that.
''And anytime I hear the wind blow it will whisper the name Edna.
'' Oh, that's very good, Lisa.
''P.
S.
: I am gay.
'' How shall we end it? How about, ''With a love that will echo through the ages.
'' Aww.
Ooh! That's sweet.
Homer, you old honey dripper.
Why, you little Hee, hee.
Huh? Wait! Wait! ''Dearest Edna, I must leave you.
Why? I cannot say.
Where? You cannot know.
How I will get there I haven't decided yet.
But one thing I can tell you any time I hear the wind blow it will whisper the name Edna.
'' Ohh.
.
! Bart, it's such a nice day today.
Let's have detention outside.
It's a date.
- Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Mmm, doughnuts.
Hey, Homer, slow down.
You're going to choke or something.
Don't tell me how to eat doughnuts.
Hey, Homer's choking again.
Isn't there a first aid chart around here somewhere? - Somebody scare him.
- That's for the hiccups.
Hey, look at this.
Softball starts this week.
Softball? Who's next? - Count me out.
- Not me.
- No way.
What's the matter with you guys? Last year we were 2 and 28.
It wasn't our best season.
Actually, it was.
This year it's gonna be different.
What makes you so damn sure? I have a secret weapon.
Hey, he's been holding out on us, huh? A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be.
Hmm.
- Count me in.
- I'm there.
Come here, boy.
I want to show you something.
What's that? A homemade bat? It's something very special-- a homemade bat.
It all started last year during a terrible thunderstorm when I locked myself out of the house.
Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find.
Something told me this was a very special very magical piece of wood that I could make a bat out of.
I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
Homie, come to bed.
Homer, go back to the garage.
And here it is.
Wow! How many home runs you going to hit with that? We play 30 games, Hit one here, Charlie! Let's go over the ground rules.
You can't leave first until you chug a beer.
Any man scoring has to chug a beer.
Chug a beer at the top of all odd-numbered innings.
And the fourth inning is the beer inning.
Hey, we know how to play softball.
Play ball! Attention all units! Attention all units! Armored car being robbed at Fifth and Main.
Turn off that damn radio! And the next man wants to hit the ball too.
And there he goes off in that direction.
And everyone is happy.
Mom, why don't you let me call the game? That's all right, dear.
I can do it.
Men, stop that! Okay, Homer, bases loaded, and you're up.
Where's that secret weapon? Check it out, boys.
My magic bat.
That's it? Yeah, I got a magic bat too.
And I got an enchanted jockstrap.
Yeah.
Just watch.
Whoo-hoo! All right, Homeboy! Yeah! Ha-ha! Cops can't win! - Get his license and registration.
- Right, Chief.
Wow, Dad.
Homer, can I get you a beer? No.
I want to get him a beer.
Kids, kids, you can each get me a beer.
But first, let's see it again in super slow motion.
Why, you-- Huh? Ooh! Such a mighty wallop.
I got my magic bat off a piano.
My sister let me use her wooden leg.
Good news, sir.
The softball team won again.
If we beat Shelbyville, we capture the pennant.
Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub, and the title is ours.
Ha! The Gladiators from my power plant will crush your team like nine flabby grapes.
I disagree.
Would you care to bet a million dollars? Why don't we make it interesting? What, a million dollars isn't interesting? Did you say a million? I'm sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.
I thought you would start with a small amount we would bait each other and-- You know how it goes.
Certainly.
A million will be fine.
Smithers, I've been thinking.
Is it wrong to cheat to win a million dollar bet? Yes, sir.
Let me rephrase that.
Is it wrong if I cheat to win a million dollar bet? No, sir.
Who would you like killed? No, Smithers.
I've decided to bring in a few ringers-- professional baseballers.
We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team.
Honus Wagner, Cap Anson Mordecai Brown-- Uh, sir.
What is it, Smithers? I'm afraid all those players have retired and, uh, passed on.
In fact, your right fielder has been dead for 1 30 years.
Damnation! Find me some good players-- living players.
Scour the professional ranks-- the American League, the National League the Negro leagues.
I'm on my way.
Oh, and, Smithers you have 2 4 hours.
I get $50,000 to play one game? That's right, Mr.
Canseco.
It's a pay cut, but what the hey.
It sounds like fun.
Uh oh-- Hey, sorry.
I thought you were a deer.
Oh, that's okay.
Happens all the time.
Are you Mike Scioscia? That's me.
How do you like working for the Dodgers? It's okay but sometimes I wish I had something more blue collar with big machines and cool dials and stuff like an oil refinery or hydroelectric plant.
We should talk.
And this is Elvis'rec room.
When the King wasn't rehearsing or exercising he liked to unwind by watching up to three TVs at once.
Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle.
Are you Ozzie Smith? Yes.
I have a proposition for you.
- Hello.
Are you Don Mattingly? Yes.
Yes, I am.
Come in.
Come in.
Can I get you something? What's your name? How would you like to be a ringer on a small-town company softball team? Would I? Now I'd like to introduce the new members of our happy power plant family.
- Our security guard, Roger Clemens.
- Hello.
- Ourjanitor, Wade Boggs.
- How you doing? - Our lunchroom cashier, Ken GriffeyJr.
- Hey, what's up, guys? Our new, well, uh we'll make up jobs for these fellas later.
Say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia andJose Canseco.
- Ooh.
- Wow.
- Geez.
By the way, you new fellas, there's a sign-up sheet for the softball team on the board over there just in case you wish to play.
- Wait a minute.
- What's going on? With them on the team, you won't need us.
Well, duh.
You, Scioscia, sign up.
I'm here to run the solid contaminate encapsulator.
One more outburst, and I'll send you back to the big leagues.
- You're Darryl Strawberry.
- Yes.
- You play right field.
- Yes.
- I play right field too.
- So? Are you better than me? Well, I've never met you, but yes.
It's not fair.
We worked so hard to get to the championship game and we'll be sitting on the bench.
You hit so many home runs.
What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry is better than you? Marge, forget it.
He's bigger than me, faster, stronger and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
You make me sick, Homer.
You're the one who told me I could do anything if I put my mind to it.
Now that you're older, I can tell you that's a crock.
No matter how good you are there's always a million people better.
Gotcha-- Can't win, don't try.
As your new manager, I want to say this up front-- No one is assured a spot in the starting lineup.
I don't care if you're Steve Sax or Darryl Strawberry or-- What's one of the bad players' names? Homer Simpson, sir.
Or Homer Simpson.
Secondly, instead of beer, you will all drink this.
It's a brain and nerve tonic rich in proteins and electromagnetic juices.
It promotes robust health.
It has been known to cause gigantism but only in rare cases.
Try some.
It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
Excellent.
Let's begin our training, shall we? Smithers the medicine balls.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Here.
What are you gonna do with your million dollars? Throw it in the pile, I suppose.
You are all very good players.
We are all very good players.
You will beat Shelbyville.
We will beat Shelbyville.
You will give 1 1 0%.
That's impossible.
No one can give more than 1 00%.
By definition, that is the most anyone can give.
I got it! I got it! Yes.
Hey! I called for that.
Put a lid on it.
There's no ''I'' in ''team.
'' Some of these guys have a bad attitude, Skip.
They sure do, Strawberry.
Scioscia, I don't get it.
You're a ringer, but you're here every night busting your butt hauling radioactive waste.
It's a relief from the pressures of playing big league ball.
There, you make any mistake, and boom-- the press is all over you.
Uh-oh.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, man, is this ever sweet.
Me, me.
Pick me.
Pick me, pick me.
I pick Ken GriffeyJr.
Aw, geez.
Okay, I'll take Millhouse.
Mr.
Boggs, will you be on my team? You got yourself a player.
Damn! All right, I'll take Louis.
I'll takeJose Canseco.
D'oh! Mattingly, get rid of those sideburns.
What sideburns? You heard me, hippie.
These guys aren't so tough.
I've got Wonderbat.
Take a knee, boys.
Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives-- The Shelbyville game.
So lights out at 7::30 and abstain from coffee, tea and cola drinks.
They pack a wallop.
Sure do, Skip.
Before I post the starting lineup I want to assure those who are not on the list that I'm very disappointed in you.
Something was lacking.
Let's call it heart.
- No hustle either, Skip.
- That's right, Darryl.
All right.
Way to go.
Aw, nuts.
Please, please, please.
Clemens, did I make the team? You sure did.
I did? Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry.
Are you Ken GriffeyJr.
? No.
Didn't mean to get your hopes up.
Ohhh.
Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow.
But that will never happen.
Three misfortunes, that's possible seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance but nine misfortunes-- I'd like to see that.
What a nice little town.
Maybe I'll buy a home here when I retire.
What seems to be the problem, officers? That's enough, smart guy.
Reach for your license.
Slowly.
Well, well.
Steve Sax from New York City.
I heard some guy got killed in New York and they never solved the case.
But you wouldn't know anything about that now, would you, Steve? But there's hundreds of unsolved murders in New York City.
You don't know when to keep your mouth shut do you, Saxy boy? Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm.
Can't lift arm or speak at normal rate.
I'm afraid you have a case of acute radiation poisoning, Mr.
Scioscia.
Will I be able to play softball tomorrow? No.
By tomorrow you'll barely be able to breathe.
Oh man.
Dr.
Hibbert Ken GriffeyJr.
needs to see you immediately.
We think it's an overdose of nerve tonic.
Good Lord! Gigantism! - My baby! My baby! - Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll save your baby.
Oh, thank you, Mr.
Canseco.
- My cat! Never fear, ma'am.
I'll save your cat.
- My player piano! Oh, man.
Ohh, one thing I'm good at, and I can't do it anymore.
Homie, you're good at lots of things.
Like what? Like snuggling.
Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me.
And I say England's greatest prime minister was Lord Palmerston! Pitt, the Elder.
Lord Palmerston! Pitt, the Elder! Okay, you asked for it, Boggs.
Uh! Yeah, that's showing him, Barney.
Pitt, the Elder.
Lord Palmerston! Nice work, boys.
We can close the book on every unsolved crime in our fair city.
Don't I get to call my lawyer? You watch too many movies, Sax.
How long does it take to see this thing? I'm in a hurry.
It's hard to say.
Once you go in, you may never come out.
Wow! One, please.
Where do you think you're going? To the game.
No.
I don't want you to see me sitting on my worthless butt.
We've seen it, Dad.
For the last time, get rid of those sideburns.
I don't know what you think sideburns are, but-- Don't argue with me! Just get rid of them! It's almost game time.
Where the devil are my ringers? Mike Scioscia may not live through the night.
Steve Sax is looking at six life sentences.
Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth.
Cool! What about Canseco? The dryer goes on the right.
Yes, ma'am.
What about Clemens? Sir, he's in no condition to play.
That damn hypnotist! You! Look what you've done.
My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken.
I'm going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association.
But I did a good job a good job.
I guess it's not your fault.
You did a good job.
Mattingly! I told you to trim those sideburns.
Go home! You're off the team! For good! Fine.
I still like him better than Steinbrenner.
All right, you ragtag bunch of misfits.
You hate me, and I hate you even more.
But without my beloved ringers you're all I've got.
So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives and go out there and win.
Not so fast, Simpson.
The man who plays your position is here.
- Hit the pine.
- Ohhh! You stink, Strawberry! We want Home Run Homer! Darryl.
Darryl.
- Darryl.
- Darryl.
- Darryl.
- Darryl.
Children, that's not very nice.
Mom, they're professional athletes.
They're used to this.
It rolls right off their backs.
Who wants peanuts? Hey, whoa! Ho, peanuts! Hey, peanuts! We got peanuts! Need some peanuts? Heads up! All right, Monty it's up to your managerial skills.
What to do-- Smithers, massage my brain.
Yes, sir.
You, Strawberry-- Hit a home run! Okay, Skip.
I told him to do that.
Brilliant strategy, sir.
Ohhh! Oh, dear! Hmm.
Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself.
Kids? We'll tell you, Mom.
All right, tie game.
Bottom of the ninth.
Two outs, bases loaded.
Strawberry coming up.
They're gonna win the city championship.
No thanks to me.
Wait.
You! Strawberry! Good effort today.
Take a lap and hit the showers.
I'm putting in a right-handed batter.
Pinch-hitting for me? Yes.
You're a left-hander and so is the pitcher.
If I send up a right-handed batter it's called playing the percentages.
It's what smart managers do to win ball games.
I've got nine home runs.
You should be very proud.
Sit down.
Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.
I am? Whoo-hoo! That a boy, Homer.
You can do it.
All right, Simpson.
Let's go over the signals.
- If I tug the bill of my cap like so - Yeah.
- it means the signal is a fake.
- Uh-huh.
- I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly.
- Got it.
If I want you to bunt, I'll touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice.
I don't understand a word he's saying.
Why doesn't he just let me bat? I wish I was home with a big bag of potato chips.
Mmm potato chips.
- Got that, Simpson? - Yes, sir.
Now batting for Darryl Strawberry-- Homer Simpson.
- All right! - Yea! - Boo! - Boo! Huh? Ugh! Oh, dear! No, Mom.
It counts as a hit.
Dad just won the game.
Well, I guess he'll be happy when he comes to.
We won! We won! All right! Homer! Homer! Homer! ## Well, Mr.

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Now, class I promised you a surprise today.
Wow! I knew it.
And here it is.
We're going to take a test.
Oh! We're going to take a test.
All right! A test! It's called the Career Aptitude Normalizing Test-- Or ''CAN'T.
'' Some of you may discover a wonderful vocation you never imagined.
Others may find out life isn't fair.
In spite of your masters from Bryn Mawr you might end up a baby-sitter to dead-eyed fourth graders while your husband runs naked on a beach with your marriage counselor! First question-- ''If I could be any animal, I would be: A) a carpenter ant B) a nurse shark or, C) a lawyer bird.
'' Question 60-- ''I prefer the smell of: A) gasoline B) french fries or, C) bank customers.
'' Well, that was a waste of time.
Janie, school is never a waste of time.
Since we have 1 5 minutes until recess please put down your pencils and stare at the front of the room.
Here for the tests.
Come on, Emma.
Here's your scientifically selected career.
Architect! Mm-hmm.
Insurance salesman.
Mm-hmm.
Salmon gutter?! Military strongman! Systems analyst,systems analyst, systems analyst.
Systems analyst.
All right! Homemaker? Mm-hmm.
It's like a mommy.
Police officer?! Well, I'll be jiggered.
If you'd like to learn more I could arrange a ride-along in a police car.
I don't need you to get me in a police car.
You should consider this.
Before I saw these test results, I had you pegged a drifter.
Wow.
A drifter.
Lousy sheriff.
Run me out of town.
He's lost my vote.
Cool.
A homemaker.
! I might as well be dead.
It's not that bad.
What will you be, boy? Policeman.
Oh, that's nice.
Your father wanted to be a policeman but they said he was too heavy.
The army said I was too heavy.
The police said I was too dumb.
I'm going to be a famous jazz musician.
I'll be unappreciated in my own country but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French.
I'll avoid drug abuse but have several torrid love affairs and I may or may not die young.
I haven't decided.
Honey, if that's what you want, we'll help.
Wait a minute.
Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps? Tell me if I have what it takes to be a blues musician.
Show me your chops.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Cool.
So, you think she has talent? Sure.
Do you think she could be a professional? Oh, Lord, no.
But I'll practice every day.
I'll be frank with you.
When I say frank, I mean devastating.
You've inherited a finger condition known as stubbiness.
It usually comes from the father's side.
D'oh! Stupid fingers.
You're wrong! You're wrong! You don't need long fingers to play the blues.
The blues come from in here.
My God, they are stubby.
I didn't steal that copper wire.
I just thought they were throwing it out.
Here.
Take it.
No.
We're here for your son.
He's coming on a ride-along.
Maybe this will straighten the boy out.
Wow! Can I see your club? It's called a baton, son.
What's it for? We club people with it.
Well! It's about time.
So you guys like being cops? Oh, it's great.
You run red lights, park wherever you please hot-and-cold-running chicks.
And when you go home at night you know you've made a difference.
See that Caddie? Uh-huh.
That's Mayor Quimby's car.
Tonight his honor is polling the electorate.
How would you like a street named after you? I tell you.
They only come out at night.
Dear log this will be my last entry for you were a journal of my hopes and dreams and now, I have none.
Do you need straight A's to be a cop? Hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad guys.
It doesn't quite work that way, son.
People see movies like McBain, and they think it's all bang-bang, shoot-'em-up cops and robbers.
Let's roll.
One-Ocean-Tango.
We're in pursuit of a speeding individual driving a red car, license number Eggplant-Xerxes- Crybaby-Overbite-Narwhal.
Oh, no.
Cops.
Whoo.
They used nylon rope this time.
It feels so smooth my skin-- almost sensuous.
Ooh, baby.
Damn boxes.
He's trapped.
Where's our backup? I don't know.
Son, this is against every regulation but would you cover us? Wow! Huh? See you in hell, punk.
See you in hell, punk! Man, that was close.
Good thing this alley got so narrow in the middle.
Well, that's nice work, boys.
Looks like you just bought yourself a lottery ticket-- to jail.
He's unconscious, sir.
Oh, they can still hear things.
Sir, I know what I want to be when I grow up-- a cop.
Until then, son I'm making you an honorary police officer.
Eddie, give him your badge.
Hey! Morning, honey.
What's so good about being stuck in the house behind a stove? Lisa, I know you're down on homemaking but it can really let you be creative.
See? This morning I turned bacon, eggs, and toast into a smiley face for Bart and Homer.
What's the point? They'll never notice.
Oh, well, you'd surprised.
Hmm, umm, hmm Now just relax your hand.
Thank you, ma'am.
You've been most cooperative.
Bad dog! Very bad dog! Mom, before you blame the dog take a look at these surveillance photos.
Oh.
Oh! Oh, Bart! I don't know how that got in there.
Lisa, why aren't you at band practice? I quit.
Right now you're discouraged but you know you love the saxophone.
I think you should stay in the band.
If you think it's so great, why don't you join the band? Lisa! People like to tell you what you can't do but they don't always know what they're talking about.
You know what I want to be? The girl on the oatmeal box? No.
I'm going to be an astronaut.
Women can't be astronauts.
Why not? They distract the men so they wouldn't keep their minds on the road.
There will be women astronauts.
It's true and we'll all live in cities on the moon.
So, you see, my sisters were wrong-- except about the cities on the moon.
I was wrong about that, so-- Well, you can see how anyone can be wrong.
Sleek, vigilant puma-- principal of the mountains.
Hi, Lis.
Want to quiz me on the vowels? I'm ready to chuck the whole alphabet.
Huh? Lisa, what are you doing? That's a bad-girl bathroom! Duh! You want to egg Skinner's car? Okay.
What are you looking at? Nothing.
Then get out.
We're figuring out stuff to egg.
Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in.
I saw some awful things in 'Nam but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma.
I never thought I'd say this but the no-goodniks rule this school.
Get your hands off me.
! God, I could really use a half day.
Think you're big men with your handcuffs and blasted Tasers! Get him out of here.
I'll get you, Bart Simpson, if it's the last thing I do! What is this all about? It's quite simple, really.
I observed our friend, Groundskeeper Willie, burning leaves-- a blatant disregard for our clean air laws.
Bart Simpson on the side of law and order?! Has the world gone topsy-turvy? That's right, man.
I got my first taste of authority and I liked it.
Hmm.
There are a lot of troublemakers in this school and I can't be everywhere at once.
Go on.
Look, let's can the euphemisms.
How would you like to be a hall monitor? Wouldn't that mean squealing on other kids? That's the meat of it.
Hmm.
Now, Witness X would you please tell the court what you saw? I'd be more than happy to.
I saw Mr.
Montone there seal Mr.
Palaccio in an oil drum and roll him off the pier.
I kill you! Ay, caramba.
! I don't know.
Oh, now, you get to wear a sash.
You got yourself a narc.
Hey,Jimbo, keeping your nose clean, dude? Hey, Donna, who loves you, baby? Not in my hall, bub.
I think you've had enough, sister.
Come on, let's keep it moving.
Pink belly! Pink belly! Pink belly! Break it up, boys.
That belly ain't going to get any pinker.
Wedgie! Thanks, Bart.
Bart's grades are up a little this term but Lisa's are way down.
Oh, we always have one good kid and one lousy kid.
Why can't both our kids be good? We have three kids, Homer.
Marge, the dog doesn't count as a kid.
No.
Maggie.
Oh, yeah.
Now take some paste and spread it on the construction paper.
Ralph, are you eating your paste? No, Miss Hoover.
Good.
Now sprinkle your sparkles on your paste.
Lisa, you're not sprinkling your sparkles.
Shove it.
I have never seen a good student take such a slide.
Lisa, what are you rebelling against? What do you got? and she goes ''Lisa told Hoover to shove it.
'' And I'm, like, ''No way--'' Hey, Lisa, man.
I'm, like, so impressed.
When I was in second grade, I was all ''I'm so good.
'' Want a smoke? Uh I'll smoke it in class.
Whoa! Whoa! Bart, you're doing a bang-up job.
There were some corridors in this school you'd never go down.
Now I feel safe anywhere.
Every day is a new fight, sir.
Bart, the school is a police state.
Students are afraid to sneeze.
I have you to thank.
Come with me.
Madre de Dios.
! The legends were true! Whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here.
Salacious halter tops complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy and this plastic derriere.
Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice.
All right! You be careful with that crossbow.
I will.
This is an absence slip signed by Nelson's mother and this is Nelson's English homework.
Notice the identical elongated loops on the D's.
Forgery! So he didn't have leprosy.
I thought I could never teach again.
Things have changed.
There will be no mockery of your name, Mr.
Glasscock.
Hey, Louis, watch this.
Ow! Bart, do something! Let's go, Milhouse.
Sure, we have order.
But at what price? Now let's correct our homework exercises.
Lisa, what 1 9th-century figure was nicknamed ''Old Hickory''? I don't know.
You? Lisa, if you'd bothered to do the assignment you'd know the answer is the Battle of New Orleans.
I mean Andrew Jackson.
Well, you're earning your 1 8 grand a year.
Stupid Hoover.
Thinks she's so smart.
She wouldn't be so smart without her teacher's edition.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen the unthinkable has happened.
Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition in this school.
What do we do? Does anyone know the multiplication table? Please, don't panic.
They can smell fear.
Children, for rest of day Martin will be teaching this class.
But I wouldn't know where to begin.
Do it, brainiac.
Have I ever told you kids about the '60s? I've got to get out of here.
Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean.
Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean.
I'm leaving again.
Mr.
Glasscock, please reconsider.
Uh-uh.
Bart, the police haven't had any luck finding the teacher's editions.
The dogs have picked up the scent of books.
Send in the battering ram.
Here we go.
We'll have to reorder every book.
Seymour, I'll bet you those books are still here.
We have to search every locker.
Locker searches aren't permitted by the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court.
What have they done for us lately? Let's move.
Hmm.
Baa! Lisa! That's right.
It was I.
Lis, why did you do it? Come on, Bart! In your pre-fascist days you knew the thrill of futile rebellion.
Yeah, but even I had my limits.
You're looking at expulsion for this.
I know! I know! The books! Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you've just saved this school $1 20.
Who's behind this monstrous crime? I am.
I've been blind.
The signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor.
Sorry I betrayed your trust, Principal ''Sucker.
'' In light of your recent service to the school I've decided to be lenient.
I can do that standing on my head.
All right, 500 days.
Ooh! Big man! Maybe I'll just shut my big mouth.
Let's go, Simpson.
Bart, why did you take the blame? 'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life.
You got the brains and talent to go as far as you want and when you do I'll be right there to borrow money.
Oh, Bart.
Sounding good, Lis.
Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! I don't need your crummy job.
I won the lottery! Well, I won the lottery too! We both won the lottery! Why don't you win the lottery too? Where everybody wins! Actual odds of winning: one in 380 million.
The lottery-- exploiter of the poor and ignorant.
You know, I heard the jackpot's up to $1 30 million.
$1 30 million? Did you say $1 30 million? Yeah.
Wow! Here's your lottery ticket.
Thank you for knocking over my inventory.
Come again.
Bart, I need some lucky numbers fast.
How old are you? What's your birthday? No kidding.
What's Lisa's birthday? What? You don't know your sister's birthday? Strap on your bulletproof vest.
It's time for another bank run.
If I don't make it promise you won't sleep with my wife.
I promise nothing.
You'll never guess what happened, Marge.
Are you ready? I have a feeling that we may win the lottery! But we never, ever-- Calm down and listen to me carefully.
Go get all your money-- I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon.
That's enough excitement for me.
The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life! Uh, the lottery and you.
We're on a tight budget.
Promise you won't get carried away.
Yes, money-- I mean honey.
Ooh! Here comes the news about the lottery.
Hey, down in front.
The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever and Springfield is no exception.
In fact, every copy of ShirleyJackson's The Lottery has been checked out from the library.
The book does not contain hints on winning the lottery.
It is a chilling tale of conformity gone mad.
There's one big winner-- our state school system which gets half the profits.
Just think what we can buy with that money-- history books that know how the Korean War came out and a state-of-the-art detention hall where children are held in place with magnets.
Magnets-- always with the magnets.
I've never been so sure of anything in my life.
I am going to win this lottery.
Homer, the odds are 380 million to one.
Correction: 380 million to 50! What will you do with your share, kids? Bank it.
Give it to the poor.
What do kids know about spending money? What about you? Hmm.
Homer, what did you do, get a haircut or something? Look closer, Lenny.
Oh, you're the biggest man in the world now and you're covered in gold.
Take a hike, boss.
I'm running things now.
All hail King Homer.
We now take you to the drawing live.
I've got my tickets.
They're about to start, Chief.
No, you got the wrong number.
This is 91 -- 2.
We'll be with you in a minute, kids.
This could be our ticket out of here, Mel.
I will now draw the first winning number.
I've got so many tickets I can't lose.
The first number is 1 7.
D'oh! You can still win money if you have five out of six.
Woo-hoo! And the second number is three.
D'oh! Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win.
Well, why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret!? If you were 1 7, we'd be rich.
But no, you had to be ten.
And the final number is 49.
Oh, my God.
I won.
I won! Recapping our day's top story: The winner of today's state lottery is me, Kent Brockman.
Can we get a shot of me? There you go.
In other news, uh a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland.
Many people killed.
Uh good-bye! Oh, well, we lost the money but we've still got each other.
Hey, the dog's dead.
He's not dead.
Don't say the dog's dead when he's not.
It's not fair to toy with people's emotions.
He is dead.
I'll get a shovel.
Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick.
Oh, sure, the old man's off his rocker.
If Grandpa says he's dead, he must be alive.
He is alive.
He's wagging his tail.
Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die.
I'm tired of this conversation.
Let's talk about something else.
I'm going home.
Clear.
Clear.
Doctor, he's gone.
This is the part of the job I hate.
You did the best you could.
I love animals.
I spend my life saving them, and they can't thank me.
The parrots can, but-- Let's see what's wrong with this little fellow.
Hmm.
I'm afraid your dog has a twisted stomach.
He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die.
How much will it cost? Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, dear.
This is never an easy decision.
Well, I guess we'll have to talk it over.
What's there to talk about? What are we going to talk over? Mr.
Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.
We're leaving the hospital.
When's the dog going to get his operation? Uh later.
First I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world-- doggie heaven.
In doggie heaven, there's mountains of bones and you can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt.
All the best dogs are there-- Old Yeller and about eight Lassies-- Is there a doggie hell? There couldn't be a heaven without a hell.
Who's in there? Oh Hitler's dog and that dog Nixon had, what's his name? Chester? Checkers.
One of the Lassies is in there too.
The mean one-- the one that mauled Timmy.
Does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper? Oh, honey, $7 50 is a lot of money.
We really can't afford this operation.
You'll let him die? I know you're upset.
Darn right I'm upset! Bart, watch your language.
Oh.
You did.
Sorry.
You're not going to let our dog die, and that's it! Lousy, dog-killing son-of-a-- Well, it will be okay.
We'll get him a new dog-- one with an untwistable stomach.
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry but we just can't afford it.
Marge, make him stop.
Oh! All right, all right, we'll find a way.
Lousy, manipulative dog.
Uh, Mr.
Burns I need to borrow money.
Please, do go on.
[ Homer.]
I know you're a good man and I have a dog that's very sick.
Oh, please, continue.
I thought maybe you-- Oh.
Well, thanks for your time.
What makes a man endanger his job and even his life by asking me for money? People like dogs, Mr.
Burns.
Dogs are idiots.
If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face what would you say? If you did it, sir? Exactly.
You'd be fit to be tied.
Dogs! Hmm.
No! You are not performing that operation yourself.
But, Marge, it looks so easy.
Just like carving a turkey.
Oh! Oh! Eww! Maybe you're right, Marge.
I found a way we can pay for the operation.
All right! Hear that, boy? What do you got, Marge, insurance scam? We're just going to have to make a few sacrifices.
Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while.
Bart, you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College.
No problemo.
I'll give up my weekly lottery ticket and I can stretch the food budget.
Fried chicken night will be organ meat night.
Ham night will be spam night, and pork chop night will be chub night.
I don't even know what that is.
Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store.
But next week is volume four-- Copernicus through elephantiasis.
We all have to make sacrifices, dear.
Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer.
Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer.
Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats.
I don't think you've thought this through.
Good news, Mr.
Danielson.
We saved your gamecock but he'll never fight again.
That's what you think.
He'll fight and he'll win.
Clamp.
Wipe.
No! No! Come to the light, boy.
Come into the light.
Come on now.
There's a good boy.
Come on.
Come on.
Um, Simpson? Oh, Santa's Little Helper, you're alive! We were so worried about you.
It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
Lousy chub night.
Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't? You wouldn't want what he's eating.
It's mostly snouts and entrails.
Mmm snouts.
Yes, I'm back.
Kent Brockman is not the kind of man who would leave a $500,000-a-year job because he won a lottery.
I'm a journalist.
He's got all the money in the world but there's one thing he can't buy.
What's that? A dinosaur.
I'm not the only one benefiting from last week's big payoff.
State schools got their share too.
Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand-new eraser.
One eraser? I'm used to my government betraying me.
I was in 'Nam.
I served for-- And speaking of lotteries here are the winning numbers for this week's $40,000 jackpot.
Oh, no! Those are my numbers.
If it wasn't for that dog, I would have won.
For tomorrow, I want you to write a report on Copernicus.
D'oh! Come on, booze hound.
You want the 25 cents? Keep singing! Who's that old rummy? Before his dog got sick that old rummy used to be my best customer.
Sing it, baby! My quarter! Okay, I'll just even this out and-- Mr.
Laswell I've done it again.
I know you can't understand me but you're a lousy dog and I hate you.
Not now.
Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station? Dumb dog.
Homie, did you close the gate? Yes.
Oh, you mean tonight.
The dog will get out.
Bart, close the gate! Oh, Lisa, close the gate! Close the gate, Maggie! Here, boy! Here, Santa's Little Helper! Oh it's all my fault.
I called him a dumb dog.
Oh, he's gone and he's never coming back.
Wait! There he is! No, that's a horse.
Have you found a picture yet? Not one that I want the public to see.
Mmm.
Oh.
Mmm.
Oh, dear.
So, recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a big hug.
Yes, well, it does sound like fun.
I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon.
Release the hounds.
Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on.
That's a good thing.
What's wrong with Crippler? He's getting on, sir.
He's been here since the late '60s.
I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie.
That young man didn't think it was too groovy.
I'm looking for something in an attack dog-- one who likes the sweet, gamey tang of human flesh.
Why, here's the fellow.
Wiry, fast, firm, proud buttocks.
Reminds me of me.
Ah, the last one.
D'oh! As an attack dog you'll be expected to neutralize intruders.
Want to buy some cookies? If that was a Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now.
I know how you feel.
I lost my dog too.
He's in here somewhere.
[ ''Ode toJoy''from Beethoven's Symphony No.
9 playing .]
Poor Santa's Little Helper.
I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
That was his dish and that was his leash and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.
Homer, get a hold of yourself.
Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry.
Remember? Doggie heaven? Oh, Marge! There is no such place.
Or to put it another way there is.
I'm not giving up.
If I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town I'm going to find my dog.
And I'll be right here watching TV.
Poka, poka, poka.
Poka, poka, poka.
Excellent.
Hello.
I'm Kent Brockman.
Excuse me, sir.
I lost my dog.
And you want me to buy you a new one.
Since I won the lottery everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman-- homeless this and hungry that.
Gee, I'm sorry, mister.
Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy.
Good! I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir but there's a sweet little boy at the door.
Release the hounds.
Santa's Little Helper! It's you! What's the matter, boy? I'm your buddy.
I love you, boy.
Let me pet him again.
You already petted him for ten minutes.
I want to pet him again.
You can pet the cat.
The cat? What's the point? Good boy, Santa's Little Helper.
Oh, good boy.
This will never happen again.
You can have anything you want.
You can sleep on my bed, you can chew on slippers.
Yeah, he's a good doggie.
Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Look, Dad, there's a spot.
- D'oh! - There's a spot, dear.
D'oh! Oh, there's a good one.
That spot says ''compact only.
'' Marge, that's just a suggested car size.
Easy.
Easy.
How am I doin' on the right? We're getting a lot of sparks here, Dad.
Uh-huh.
Easy.
Easy.
Perfect.
All right, everybody, out the window.
They all look great.
What are we going to see? Ernest Cuts the Cheese.
! Honey, I Hit a School Bus.
! Look Who's Oinking.
! Since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie your dad and I will pick one, then we'll all meet in the lobby later.
Thanks, Mom.
- Two tickets for-- - Let me guess.
Look Who's Oinking.
- That's right.
- Sold out.
Maybe we could see something a little more adult.
Why, Marge, you frisky little devil.
[ Sexy Growl .]
We'll take two tickets to The Stockholm Affair.
Ooh.
The paper called it a taut political thriller.
Political? Mr.
President, disturbing news.
Serious cracks are developing in the Greco-Bolivian alliance.
Get meJed Colic! Oh, this movie's too complicated.
Hey, the floor's sticky.
Who's that guy? What did that guy say when I said, ''Who's that guy?'' Oh, that submarine is so fake.
Look, you can see the strings.
Ooh! An octopus! - Shh! - What? If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it.
Just tell me when the scary part's over.
- It's over.
- I think that guy's a spy.
- Of course he's a spy.
You just saw him go through spy school.
Oh, wait.
I heard how this ends.
Turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter.
It's pretty obvious if you think about it.
Shut up, Homer! No one wants to hear what you think! Yeah! Homer, if it makes you feel any better most of what they threw at you splattered on me.
Homer? Forget it, Mom.
Dad's really mad.
His tendons are throbbing.
Stress is collecting in the trouble spots-- here, here, and here-- making for one unhappy pappy.
Homie, aren't you coming inside? Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity.
Tonight, you robbed me of it.
I'm going now, and I don't know when you'll see me again.
I guess that executive stress ball we got him isn't working.
Mmm.
Eww, a skunk.
Oh, no! - Ooh, a redneck bar.
Hey, you, let's fight.
Them's fightin' words.
Duff, please.
We don't sell Duff.
We sell Fudd.
Okay, Fudd me.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen he's all healed up and back for more.
Let's give a big drunken welcome to Yodeling Zeke.
Yodel-lay-hee Yodel-lay-hee Odel-lay-hee Our next act is our very own singing waitress-- Lurleen.
So I'm afraid drink service will stop for a moment-- They're all yours.
Stupid Marge.
Tell me to shut up.
Thank you.
Tonight I'd like to try something different.
It's a song I wrote while I was mopping up your dried blood and teeth.
You work all day for some old man - # Sweat and break your back # - Yeah.
Then you go home to your castle But your queen won't cut you slack That's true.
That's why you're losing all your hair - #That's why you're overweight # - Uh-huh.
That's why you flipped your pickup truck Right off the interstate That's right, except for the truck.
There's a lot of bull they hand you There's nothing you can do Your wife don't understand you But I do No, your wife don't understand you But I do I said, no one understands you But I do Hey, Lurleen? I gotta say something to you.
- I'm listening.
- Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before.
And which way to the can? - So, what's your name, stranger? - HomerJ.
Simpson.
I'm Lurleen Lumpkin.
- That's a pretty name.
- You think so? Maybe.
I'm not sure.
I forgot it.
Bye, Lurleen.
So long, HomerJ.
Simpson.
Hello.
Where were you all night? I was at this bar in Spittle County.
You should have called.
I was worried.
Let's end this feudin' and a-fussin' and get down to some lovin'.
##I work all day ## Doctor, you weren't supposed to remove his gall bladder.
Put it back! Put it back! ## Your wife don't understand you ## But I do Gee, Homer's singing to his ball again.
- He's bowling a 280.
- Oh, yeah? There's a kind of hush All over the world tonight Moe, you got any Fudd? Fudd? They took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
No-- I went to this bar the other night and-- Wait a minute.
You went to another bar? Moe, I was 1 00 miles out of town.
Oh, Homer.
Well, if it isn't HomerJ.
Simpson.
I can't get your song out of my mind.
I haven't felt this way since ''Funkytown.
'' Aren't you sweet.
Can I get a copy of it? Sorry, darling.
All my songs are up here-- ''I'm Basting a Turkey With My Tears'' ''Don't Look Up My Dress Unless You Mean It'' ''I'm Sick of Your Lying Lips and False Teeth.
'' We've got to crack open your head and scoop out those songs.
- I don't know.
- Come with me.
I said no one understands you But I do Listen, ma'am.
My brother owns a radio station in Weevilville and I'd like to take your C.
D.
to him.
Homer, it's your quarter.
What do you say? I guess so.
This is KUDD 570 AM.
Don't touch that dial.
You've got KUDD on it.
You work all day for some old man Sweat and break your back For the next half hour, beer's on the house.
- What did you say, Moe? - Nothing.
I thought I told you to stay away from my sister! But your queen won't cut you slack Oh, here's 50 bucks.
Take her to the Copa.
Now you talk so tough and act so rough It's payback time.
The heartache and the sadness That's buried deep inside Aww.
Puts this whole riot into perspective, doesn't it? No one understands you, but I do She's wonderful.
I could feel her country soul in every digitally encoded bit.
Country music sucks.
It takes precious air space from shock deejays whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
Shut up, boy.
Marge, what do you think? It's nice, but who is this woman? Right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress but she's going to be a country music superstar like that jerk in the cowboy hat and that dead lady.
I don't like you hanging around some waitress.
You make it sound so seamy.
All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits.
Hi, Lurleen.
We were just talking about you.
I think I can come over.
Let me ask my wife.
It's a date.
Oh, Homer.
Everybody's been calling-- Mama, Daddy, the triplets Vonda Mae, PineyJoe-- and I owe it all to you.
Don't thank me.
You should be thanking your brain.
Oh, Homer.
No man has ever been this nice to me without you know, wanting something in return.
I was gonna ask for some water, but now I feel guilty about it.
Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.
- Thanks.
You did say ''sugar,'' right? - Uh-huh.
Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager.
Really? I should warn you, I'm not great with figures.
- That's okay.
- I make stupid decisions.
- Nobody's perfect.
- I did bad in school.
- I didn't even go.
- My personal hygiene has been described as-- Homer, Homer, you'll be a great manager.
There's only one thing you need.
This is made from a space-age fabric developed especially for Elvis.
Sweat actually cleans this suit.
Hmm.
Marge, look at me.
I don't want to.
I'm mad at you.
I'm sick of that waitress and this whole country music thing.
Then you'd better not look at me.
Homer, where did you get that suit? A friend bought it for me.
Was it Lurleen? No.
I think it was Lenny.
Don't lie to me.
- Are you having an affair? - No! - Have you kissed her? - No! - Has she kissed you? - Couple of times.
I want you to stop seeing her.
I can't.
I'm her manager.
Her manager! That's ridiculous.
I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
You're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer! Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie.
You did it at the county fair last year, remember? Lurleen will be a big success, and I'll be there.
Fine.
See if I care! [ Man .]
This studio has history.
Buddy Holly stood here in 1 958 and said ''There is no way in hell I'll record in this dump.
'' I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
How much did you just give that man? Calm down, Marge.
Just our life savings.
I'm not going into hock for this.
Hey, Colonel Homer.
And you must be-- - Mrs.
Homer Simpson.
- Charmed.
I thought you said she was overweight.
It takes two to lie-- one to lie and one to listen.
What does that mean? I don't have time to answer that.
Time is money.
Come on, people.
Well, come on, boys.
Let's break some hearts.
Oh, the bases were empty on the diamond of my heart When the coach called me up to the plate I'd been swingin' and missin' At lovin' and kissin' My average was point double-0 eight So I spit on my hands Knockin' dirt from my spikes And pointed right towards center field This time I'm hittin' a home run This time love is for real Hey, Dad, can I do a hambone solo? Stop it.
for you I been slumpin' all season But now I found a reason I struck on a love that is true I used to play the field I used to be a roamer But season's turnin' around for me now I finally bagged me a Homer That's right.
I finally bagged me a Homer Lurleen, we'll have to cut you off.
We're getting a grinding noise on the track.
You, off the bench.
Guess what, Lurleen.
I got you a gig on TV.
Oh, Homer, you're as smart as you are handsome.
Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment.
Now, on this show they want you to sing two songs.
Maybe we should give them something new.
Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up.
Let's hear it.
In this trailer I get so cold and lonely Lyin' there awake at night Muttering, ''If only you weren't married'' So I might ask you to Bunk with me tonight Bunk with me tonight Oh, bunk with me tonight I'm asking will you bunk with me Tonight Oh, that's hot.
There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that.
Well, good-bye.
Uh, Homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed.
Really listen.
Bunk with me tonight - Uh-huh.
- # Bunk with me # Tonight - Right.
- # I'm asking # #Will you bunk # #With me tonight ## - Lurleen! - That's right, HomerJ.
I gotta think about this.
All our money's tied up in this woman.
If she fails, we're broke.
If she succeeds, I have no husband.
I don't know what to root for.
- You don't? - I gotta go.
- Homer? - Later, Marge.
Lurleen's on TV tonight.
I gotta get ready.
Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest Maggie got her first tooth.
That's great, honey.
Have you seen my rattlesnake hatband? You're not even listening to me.
Sure they will.
Kids, will you come in here? You've got a wonderful family, Homer.
Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight.
Uh, I gotta go.
As much as I hate that man right now you got to love that suit.
Hold on to your pitchforks, everybody.
It's time again for Ya Hoo.
! Starring, in alphabetical order Yodeling Zeke, ButterballJackson Freddie Boy and Yuma, Cloris Moselle Big Shirtless Ron Orville and Hurley, Gappy Mae Hip Diddler, Rudy the Ya Hoo Recovering AlcoholicJug Band and tonight, in her syndicated TV debut-- Lurleen! Oh, the bases were empty Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson? - Yes, I am.
- I'm from Rebel Yell Records.
- I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract.
- Forget it, pal.
They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy.
Lurleen, they loved you.
I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
Is there anything you need? Well, you could make my evening complete.
What's wrong? My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
- Gross! Thanks for dinner.
Ow! No! At least, could I have my dollar-- I'll love you for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry, Lurleen.
All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people, and I've done that.
Now, I'd better get out of here before I lose my family.
Just so I don't wonder--you would have gone all the way with me? - Uh-huh.
- Ooh.
Okay.
Before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen and I'll take any offer.
- I'll give you 50 bucks.
- You son of a-- Sold.
I caught my wife in bed with my best friend.
- You bitter? - Yep.
Bit him too.
And now, once again-- Lurleen.
Homer? Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burned fool? Always has been.
I'd like to play a song I wrote just this minute.
It's called ''Stand By Your Manager.
'' His name is Homer He's quite a man I tried to kiss him But Homer ran Sure wish I could say That I was his I hope that Marge knows Just how lucky she is I do.
Shh!

D'oh! Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music? Don't have a stegosaurus, man.
These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Look, Maggie, they have a baby too.
It's like they saw our lives and put it up on screen.
Kids, I know you're excited about meeting Aunt Selma's boyfriend.
Before he gets here I should tell you something about him-- something disturbing.
Ooh! Ooh! Ee-ugh! Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone so in desperation she joined this prison pen pal program.
Her new sweetie is a jailbird.
Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray.
Now, now, he's an ex-convict.
He's paid his debt to society.
Then why aren't you using the good silverware? - I'm just not.
That's them.
Remember, everyone be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity.
Everyone I'd like you to meet-- Aah! It's Sideshow Bob! What the.
.
? I'm afraid their reaction is understandable.
Bart is the shamus in short pants who sent me to prison.
Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown - for armed robbery.
If some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison the first thing out I'd find out where he lives and tear him a new belly-button.
Lousy snitch.
Yaah! You're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha.
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.
One: existence is suffering.
Two: the cause of suffering is desire-- in this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming.
When prison ended that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination.
When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards my bitterness ruined the greatest night of my life.
And the nominees are: Droopy Drawers Colonel Coward Pepito, the biggest cat in the whole wide world Sideshow Bob and Suckup the Vacuum.
And the Emmy goes to I don't believe this Sideshow Bob.
This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win you bantering jack-in-the-box! Just don't drop it in the shower.
- No-talent, shill! - Second banana! - Panderer! - Bore! Uh, now for the highlight of the evening-- Best film-to-video transfer.
Do you know what prison is like for a life-long Republican? In our overcrowded cell we became little more than beasts.
- Who used my chap stick? - Oh, I did.
Here you go.
I don't want it.
My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there.
Ay, caramba! Bart, if I wanted to kill you - I'd have choked you as soon as I walked in.
But what kind of guest would I have been? Now, where was I? Ah, yes-- my lowest ebb.
You can't take my Emmy.
You know the rules: awards for entertainment are contraband.
No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe.
But kismet be kind, well as cruel.
I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program.
''Dear #2 460 1 ''I need a man and cannot find one ''among the law abiding.
''I have a steady job and a lucrative hobby:: ''filing nuisance lawsuits.
''I share an apartment with my twin sister.
''Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike.
I forget which one I am.
'' ''Dear Selma ''your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum-security wing of my heart.
'' - Ohhh - [ Pffft .]
Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard our love bloomed despite all obstacles.
Selma, may I? Uh, uh, uh on the cheek.
Inspired by the love of a good woman I resolved to be the best darned inmate #2 460 1 I could be.
I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved.
Cutter.
Icepick.
Snake.
I'm going to miss you most of all.
Aww! What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob.
You're living proof that our revolving-door prison system works.
I've never seen you so happy-- giggling like a schoolgirl.
I've got to admit it, Selma he's a once-in-a-lifetime catch.
I hope the police are saying that as well.
I can't believe you guys.
This man framed Krusty the Clown.
- Bart! - Indeed, I did and I thank you for catching me.
You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell, and pointed it towards the sunny shores of Selma.
Here, here.
Would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family? All right, but no tongues.
Though kissing you is like kissing some divine ashtray that's not what I had in mind.
- Selma, will you marry me? - [ Gasps .]
Don't be a fool.
That man is scum.
Then call me ''Mrs.
Scum.
'' Could you pumice my corns for me? Avec plaisir.
''A'' ''G'' ''Q'' Seven Close enough.
May you drive safely and find true love.
We now return to Whoo-hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys.
So tragic.
So nauseous.
You should see the bus they came to the studio in.
What's next? Oh, yeah.
And now, a man who needs no introduction ''The Chairman of the Company''-- you know who I'm talking about.
Get out here, you gumba! who wants to say hello.
- Huh? What? - I can't believe it! They've been feuding for years.
Come here, you.
- Oh, you old clown, you.
- I missed you.
This guy is a national treasure.
That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle.
All I can be is myself.
Krusty, can you ever forgive me for putting you in jail? If they open the books on this telethon I'm right back in there.
- That Sideshow Bob is a no-good show biz phony.
Come on, Bart.
If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him surely you can too.
Now, about your wedding dress how should I put this? - White! - White.
What would you like for appetizers? Ooh, appetizers.
Homer, you're a trencherman.
What should we serve? Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies.
They taste as good as they look and they come in this delicious red sauce.
It looks like ketchup, it tastes like ketchup but, brother, it ain't ketchup! Selma, he makes a good case.
Whatever you want.
It all tastes like Styrofoam to me.
Selma, dear, I'm confused.
When I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets and one shot straight up my nose.
I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Okay, we've got cocktail weenies and Swedish meatballs.
Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control.
I've run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison.
I told you I got money.
I bought stock in a Mace company just before society crumbled.
Selma, that's wonderful! I hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money instead of your less tangible qualities.
Tomorrow we'll be Mr.
and Mrs.
Bob Terwilliger.
Isn't it grand? Hey, Bob, give some of that honey this way.
Mmm mmm! Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver.
Driver, here's a fin.
Get me home, and don't spare the whip.
Whatever you say, mum.
- What did I miss? MacGyver was wearing a tank top.
Dang.
But I'm the only man in your life.
Sit down and shut up! SeÃ±or MacGyver, you saved our village.
Don't thank me.
Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
That MacGyver's a genius.
First of all, he's not a genius.
He's an actor.
And second, he's not much of an actor.
You're lying.
You're lying! No, this is lying-- that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me retch.
- No! He was so cruel.
The things he said they're just not true.
There.
There.
The wedding's off.
Fiddle-dee-dee.
Tomorrow's another day.
Bart, stop that! No, he's right.
We're a package.
Love me, love MacGyver.
I guess the wedding's off.
Selma, I don't know what to say.
Just tell me you like MacGyver.
Very well.
I-- I-- I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
Would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes but it's no big deal.
You know why? - No.
- Go on.
Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk.
I go to a bar, I pound a few then I stumble home in the mood for love.
Very well, Selma.
Whenever you watch MacGyver I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love than ever.
Oh, Bob.
Bart no like.
Bad medicine.
I could have been the flower girl and I wouldn't keep falling down either.
Hey, they chose Maggie, okay? If you want to go for cutesyness instead of competence, fine.
Do you, Bob, take Selma to have and to hold, in sickness and in health till death do you part? - Mmm.
- Oh.
Hey, wiener boy where do you think you're going? I'm the only single girl left in the family.
Well, I guess it could be worse.
Oh, there's Krusty the Clown.
Krusty! Krusty, say something funny.
Oh, gee, a joke, huh? Um uh funny.
Okay, this guy walks into a bar and takes out a tiny piano and a 1 2-inch pianist-- Oh, no, wait.
I can't tell that one.
Dear friends, 41 years ago God took 1 68 pounds of clay, and he made me a woman and for this, I thank him.
I just wanted to say on the advice of my new husband I've decided to give up smoking except for after meals and after MacGyver.
Selma, dear, you'll bury us all.
Chief Wiggum, you've been around.
You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you? Lighten up, son.
If he was going to commit a crime would he have invited the number-one cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah.
I set it down when I got some cake.
I don't know what to say.
Just tell me what you know I want to hear.
I'm dying of jealousy.
Thank you.
That's right, dear.
Enjoy your rest.
The wedding was very tough on you and the honeymoon is going to be murder.
Welcome to our video honeymoon.
We're using the video camera cousin Doug gave us and the videocassette Homer gave us.
Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it.
There's Shelbyville Falls, Rolling Rock and here's another breathtaking sight my brand-new hubby.
I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure! Oh, Selma, dear.
I was just chatting with my good friend Dennis.
Now, smile for the camera, that's a good lad.
Ah, fire-- Scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows eradicator of deadwood.
Oh, Selma, dear-- you and your little camera.
What do you say we shut it off for a while? And make love? I suppose so.
Oh, that's sweet.
Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace? Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
Romantic? With Aunt Selma? I guess you're too young to understand.
Hmm Bob, one of my fillings fell out.
Even murder has its ugly side.
Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet? Darling, you make it sound like a chore.
Ooh.
Oh.
Good.
Mmm.
- Soon I will kill you.
- Huh? Son pieds sentit beau-- French for ''her foot smells lovely.
'' Oh.
Prepare to be murdered.
Huh? That's Sanskrit for ''your toes are like perfume.
'' - Voy a matar a usted.
- Wha? That's Spanish for ''I am going to kill you.
'' - Say what? - I do believe it's time for your beloved MacGyver.
- Oh, hey, you're right.
- Well, time for my walk.
- Mm.
Don't forget to die.
Ding-dong.
I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma.
Mind if I watch TVwith you? Oh, go ahead, Patty.
Tonight, on MacGyver MacGyver MacGyver MacGyver Aunt Selma has one hour to live.
Hey, down in front.
Good-bye.
Front desk, there's been a terrible accident in my room! Poor Selma.
You were having such a lovely evening Selma! Oh! You tried to kill me.
I want a separation.
My best-laid plans have gang agley.
Do you have room in your jail for a two-time loser? No, but that never stopped us before.
Bart, I must know how did you untangle my web? Yeah, Bart, clue us in.
I'd hate to tell the number-one cop in town how to do his job.
No, please, it's the only way I'll learn.
All right.
Sideshow Bob seemed desperate to get that fireplace, but why? Then it hit me-- The gas! Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak except Aunt Selma.
I permanently lost my sense of smell.
She happily watched MacGyver unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas.
All it needed to explode was a single spark, say, from a cigarette.
I've decided to give up smoking except after meals and MacGyver.
Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
When Aunt Selma lights up after MacGyver she'll be blown to kingdom come.
Come again? After trying four times to explain it to Homer I explained it to Mom and we were on our way! To the Simpson Mobile! But wait.
If you saved Selma, why did the room explode? Oh, I'll field that one.
Oh, right, the gas.
with all my criminal buddies! I feel like such a fool.
Well, he fooled almost everyone but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust.
Thanks, Mom.
Now, let's get out of this gas-filled hallway - before we all suffocate.
- Shh.

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Hey, Homer, let's book! I want to whip eggs at the warm-up act.
Wow, my concert-going jacket still fits.
And this is where I used to hide my beer.
Billy Beer! My little guy's first rock concert.
I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
Oh, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.
I hear you.
Come on, boy.
There goes Davy Crockett in his bald-skin cap.
In other Spinal Tap news Mayor Quimby honored the aging super group in a ceremony at city hall.
''Tapping'' into the ''spines'' of young voters, huh? Let's play the tape.
Hey, Milhouse, cool jacket.
It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe comics.
Meet me here after the show.
Thanks, Dad.
You won't be bored? Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car.
Ohhh Oh, baby.
Ahh.
Official tour '92 T-shirts, $31 .
Check it out-- Spinal Tap kicking Moammar Khadafy in the butt.
A timeless classic.
Hey, Bill and Marty here.
And we're rapping with the Tap.
Fellas, this phrase has dogged you throughout your career-- ''Washed up.
'' Yet you're among the top 1 05 concert acts today.
What's your secret, guys? After the Berlin Wall fell our records started selling on the dismal side of the Iron Curtain.
That gave us a boost.
We're big in Bulgaria, and the other Garia.
Hungaria? Who's benefited more from the death of communism than us? Maybe the people who live in communist countries.
I bet you're right.
But we each just bought our own soccer team.
How many Hungarios can say that? Test test Gee, I'm sorry, man.
Huh? About the frisbee.
Frisbee? Would you mind recording some promos? Like what? Maybe you could say ''Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL.
'' We don't know that.
What if somebody rocks as good as you? Or better.
We don't want to look stupid.
We respect that.
How about, ''Rock-a-doodle-doo! You're listening to Bill and Marty''? - Yeah, sure.
- That's good.
Tap! Tap! Tap! There's puddles of water all over the freakin' stage.
Well, I don't want to lie.
Six days a week the place is a hockey rink.
Well, this is a rock concert not the bleedin' splish-splash show.
Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes is proud to welcome Spinal Tap! Medium setting.
Thank you! All right! This morning we were driving down route 401 .
That's only four miles from my house! And we thought they could rock in Shelbyville.
But nobody rocks like Springfield! Well, it seems some silly twit did not get a big enough oxygen pump but that's supposed to be a devil.
Filled with air, it's very evil and impressive.
We salute you, our half-inflated dark lord! - Oy! - Oy! Oy! People think there are only five members of Spinal Tap but they're wrong.
Could we turn up the house lights? That was the cue to turn up the lights so we can tell the audience they're the sixth member of the freakin' group! We are trying to put a tiny thrill into their gray little lives.
Oh, forget it.
Turn on the lasers.
Aah! My vision.
That's it.
Show's over.
Good night, Springden.
There will be no encores.
They were only on for 20 minutes.
What a gyp.
Gnarly show, man.
Want to trash the stage? Okay.
Aah! Tonight the city weeps as for the first time ever a hockey arena becomes the scene of violence following a concert by Spinal Tap.
I hope my poor little baby's okay.
See for yourself.
Unh! It would be wrong to suggest this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll.
After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart's The Magic Flute.
So, what's the answer-- ban all music? In this reporter's opinion, the answer is yes.
Hi, Mom.
Oh Oh, thank God.
Mom, I want to be a rock star.
Mm We'll discuss it later.
Is Milhouse okay? Uh I'll be right back.
Help! Help! I've been thinking about what Bart said.
If he's really interested in being a musician let's buy him a guitar.
We already have a guitar.
I meant a real guitar.
This is real.
Wow! And it came with a free instruction book.
We spent a lot of money so you get real good, real fast, or pow.
! Homer! I thought I was supposed to encourage him.
I'd like to play me latest chart topper.
It's called ''Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs.
'' Bart, you've got to go on.
Slag off.
You've changed, man.
It used to be about the music.
I said slag off!.
Cool! Knock it off.
I'm sorry.
Knock it off!.
I's just jammin' with ya.
Hey, Simpson what are you trying to play? ''Polly-wolly Doodle.
'' Oh, yeah? Well, it sounds Polly-wolly crappy.
Burn.
Hey, cherry ax, Bart dude.
I think it's broken.
Oh, really? Give it here.
I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto man.
That's all I did in high school.
My old man said I was wasting my time and I'd never amount to anything.
I, uh Hmm.
Now I'd like to slow things down a little bit.
Although I'm sure I will receive a wedgie from my bus mates I must remind you we should have been at school ten minutes ago.
Uh-oh.
Better fasten your seat belts, little dudes.
We don't have seat belts.
Uh Well, then just try to go limp.
Better take a shortcut.
Good show last night.
Yeah, quite good.
Good Lord! Did anyone get the license number? - Gee, I forgot.
- Uh, no.
Yay! Whee! It's a miracle no one was hurt.
I stand on my record-- a single fatality.
Let's see your license, pal.
No can do.
Never got one.
If you need proof of my identity I wrote my name on my underwear.
Oh, wait-- these aren't mine.
Until you get a license and wear your own underwear you are suspended without pay.
Who will drive the bus? I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang.
I think I can handle it.
Where's Otto? That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for a while.
Off we go.
Oh, there's an opening.
Oh, too late.
Nope, nope Uh That would cut it a little close.
You have to be more aggressive, sir.
Nonsense.
One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
Nope.
What's so funny? I was thinking about the time Homer caught his nose in the toaster.
We'll watch the tape tonight.
You got someone at your window.
My name's Patty.
I'll be testing you.
When you do good, I use the green pen.
When you do bad, I use the red pen.
Any questions? Yeah, one: Have you always been a chick? No offense, but you were born a man, weren't you? You can tell me.
I'm open-minded.
I won't be needing this.
All right! Yeah! How did I do? Well, you failed every segment and misspelled ''bus'' on your application.
Drag.
Let me in.
Let me in! Shut up! Hey, Landlord, some clown changed my locks padlocked the door, and put up an eviction notice.
Yeah.
That was me.
You? Well, uh Why? You haven't paid your rent.
Can I at least get my stuff? All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old Cycle magazines.
Wow! I had mustard? Rough day, Apu.
Pump me a squishee and don't spare the syrup.
Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental flavor of mine-- a delicious chutney squishee.
Uh Okay.
You can really taste the chutney.
Ow! Otto man? You're living in a Dumpster? Oh, man, I wish.
Dumpster brand trash bins are top-of-the-line.
This is just a Trash-co waste disposal unit.
Come home with me.
You can stay in our garage.
A garage! Somebody up there likes me.
Whoo! Hey.
Bart, what's going on? Mom, I thought you might forget our conversation this afternoon so I took the precaution of recording it.
What conversation? Mom, can Otto live in our garage? He sure can.
Marge, what were you thinking? That's not my voice.
Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.
I don't understand this.
Why can't you stay with your parents? The admiral and I don't get along.
Please, I've got nowhere else to go.
Forget it-- That line didn't work for my dad and it won't work for you.
Otto's going through a tough time.
Can't he stay for a while? I know we didn't ask for this, Homer but doesn't the Bible say ''Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers that you do unto me''? But doesn't the Bible also say ''Thou shalt not take moochers into thy hut''? Please, Dad? If you let Otto stay he'll help around the house and chip in a few bucks.
All right, he can stay but I get to treat him like garbage.
Wow, what's the catch? The can of corn costs 57 Â¢! I could sure go for a can of corn.
Otto you can't just sit there watching TV all day.
You're right.
I should do a little reading.
Uh, you got any of those Where's Waldo? books? No.
- Anything from the vampire's point of view? - No.
Anything where guys send in naked pictures of their chicks? You should get a job.
The only thing I was ever good at was bus driving and now I need a piece of paper to do that.
So get that piece of paper.
I tried! Oh, Lord, how I did try.
Knock it off!.
I can't hear myself think.
I want some peanuts.
That's better.
How come you never play your guitar anymore? I'll tell you the truth.
I wasn't good at it, so I quit.
I hope you're not mad.
Son, come here.
Of course I'm not mad.
If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing.
You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your shortwave radio your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV.
What's on? It doesn't matter.
Open up! Open up! I got to go, and no fooling.
Hey, Pop-N-Fresh! You're supposed to giggle.
Gyyaaagh!! That guy has got to go.
I know how you feel but he is good with the kids.
So the lady drove faster, but the strange car kept banging into her from behind.
So, finally, she swerved off the road into the woods and lost the other car and that's when she realized the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her.
No-- He was trying to warn her about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat! Did the maniac kill her? Natch.
You know how I know? How? Because I was that maniac.
Hey, I was just kidding.
That's it.
He's out of here.
But we're the only family he's got.
This is not Happy Days, and he is not the Fonz.
Hey-y-y, Mr.
S.
Listen, you drain-clogging, last-cookie-eating collect-call-getting sponge.
I want you out of my house.
Heavy.
What will you do, Otto? Oh, don't worry.
There's plenty of money out there for a guy who knows how to fake his own death.
Before you do that maybe you should take the driving test again.
I can't pass that thing.
I got a zero last time.
This time I'm hung over.
You can do it.
You're the coolest adult I ever met.
Wow.
I've never been called an adult before.
I've been tried as one, but I'll do it.
''Alcohol increases your ability to drive.
'' False?! Oh, man! I don't know about this, Bart dude.
Your dad is right.
I am a bum.
He didn't call you a bum.
He called you a sponge.
Sponge?! Does this look like something a sponge would do?! I'll show him who's a sponge.
Well, if it isn't Wee Willy Washout.
- I want to take the test again.
- Why? So I can staple my license to Homer Simpson's big bald head! Really? Well, here's your written test.
I'll get you started.
''B,'' ''C,'' ''D,'' ''A,'' ''B'' Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days.
It wasn't little either.
It was a chicken wing.
Wing! Ooh, what was that? It doesn't matter.
Let's get some margaritas.
I'm buying.
Otto! That's what my driver's license says.
Yes, hail to the bus driver bus driver man.
- Shh!

## The Simpsons ## Ahh.
Why, you little.
.
! [ Raiders ofThe Lost Ark Theme Playing .]
What the.
.
? D'oh! Bart, look at this.
My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted.
Cool-- An oversize novelty billiard ball.
You shake it up and it tells the future.
Really? Uh-huh.
Will I pass my English test? ''Outlook not so good.
'' Wow, it does work! Let me try.
Will I get beat up today? ''All signs point to yes.
'' That ball knows everything.
I got one.
Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair in our ears? Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day? What could come between two bestest buddies like us? Samantha, I've always been suspicious of transfer students.
Other principals unload problem cases that way.
Lord knows I do.
I'm a good student.
Yeah, sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam.
Instead, they spat on me.
I can still feel it searing.
So, let's just see what the permanent record has to say.
No detention, fairly good attendance I see you beat that bed-wetting problem.
Don't worry.
They'll forget just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for 1 8 agonizing months.
Every night I wake up screaming.
Well, let's meet your classmates.
Bart, was this thing right about your test? To those who doubt the Magic Eight Ball's power I say, behold my ''F.
'' Attention, class.
I have a new student for you.
Great.
Just keep packing them in, Seymour.
We should discuss this later.
It's never easy to come to a new school.
Let's make her feel right at home.
Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky.
Stanky.
Oh, right.
How embarrassing for you.
Well, good-bye.
I'm sure this is a little scary for you Uh-huh.
So why don't you tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
We just moved here from Phoenix.
My dad's in home security.
He came here because of the high crime rate and lackluster police force.
All my friends are back in Phoenix and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to but I'm not.
It takes about six weeks.
Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie? Sure.
Eww! Victim number four.
Louis, can I interest you in a wet willie? Sure aah! When I find out who hit me with ball I'm going to tear them a new.
.
! Whoa! In order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth-talking lothario with a car and tight jeans I will now show a short sex education film.
Ezekiel and Ishmael in accordance with your parents' wishes you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls.
Hello.
I'm actor Troy McClure.
You kids might remember me from such educational films as Lead Paint:: Delicious But Deadly and Here Comes The Metric System.
I'm here to provide the facts about sex in a frank and straightforward manner.
And now, here's This is Fuzzy Bunny.
About a year ago he noticed his voice was changing he had terrible acne and had fur where there was no fur before.
He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.
Boring.
Fluffy and Fuzzy went to the park the ice cream social the boat show and other wholesome activities and they never ruined their fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges.
Then came the big day.
Fluffy and Fuzzy got married.
That night came the honeymoon.
Eww! She's faking it.
The most satisfying part was knowing that they waited.
Nine months later Fluffy gave birth to 1 4 beautiful bunnies.
Eight survive.
And now that you know how it's done don't do it.
Any questions? Mrs.
Krabappel how come you don't live with Mr.
Krabappel? Because Mr.
Krabappel chased something fluffy down a rabbit hole.
How do we know when we fall in love? Oh, don't you worry.
Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone.
How do I create a half man, half monkey-type creature? I'm sorry, that would be playing God.
God, shmod-- I want my monkey man.
Uh that's a nice dress.
My dad makes me wear it.
I hate it.
I hate it too.
Uh can I walk you home? Okay.
Everybody on.
No shoving.
Just kidding.
You can shove all you want.
Hey, Otto Man, you can't leave.
Milhouse isn't here yet.
No time, Bart Dude.
My girlfriend's dancing topless at the airport bar from 4:1 5 to 4:20.
Hey, Bart.
Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise.
Hi.
What's with the skirt? I've brought friends to this tree house before.
But never a girl.
What if I want to strut around nude? Maybe I should go.
No, you can stay.
You can read comics with us.
Let's see, something for the lady ah-- Radioactive Man vs.
The Swamp Hag.
Got any girl comics like Bonnie Crane, Girl Attorney Punkin and Dunkin, the Twinkle Twins or Li'l Knee Socks? No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics.
Eww! You guys want to see something gross? [ Announcer.]
Tonight on Smartline:: ''I'm okay.
You're too fat.
'' Here's your host, Kent Brockman.
Good evening.
Did you know that 34 million american adults are obese? That excess blubber could fill two-fifths of the Grand Canyon.
That may not sound impressive but keep in mind, it is a very big canyon.
This sucks.
Where's that channel changer? Oh.
I'll give it a chance.
Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man-- Dom DeLuise Alfred Hitchcock, and, of course Santa Claus.
But in real life Santa would be suffering from gall stones hypertension, impotence, and diabetes.
I wish they had never invented fried cheese.
We got to widen the hole.
Hurry-- The chain's starting to give.
We take 1 8 ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter.
Then we top it off with bacon, ham, and a fried egg.
We call it the Good Morning Burger.
I've got to help him.
Okay, Milhouse I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel.
Deal.
Next, your Mickey Mantle for my picture of Homer on the couch.
Milhouse, I've got to go.
My dad thinks I'm having my braces examined.
Well, you kind of sort of are.
Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties.
I can't believe the risk you're running.
Besides, what's so great about kissing? It's not just the kissing.
A lot of it is waiting to kiss.
You know, like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little for it to melt? But she doesn't melt.
Oh, yes, she does.
We start with pure milk chocolate Chocolate add a layer of farm-fresh honey Oh, sweet.
then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar and dip it in rich creamery butter.
What if I told you you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger? I'd say you're a lying scumbag.
Why, sweetie? According to Eternity magazine you can lose weight subliminally.
An idea is subtly implanted in your head without your knowing it.
That's a load of rich creamery butter.
You listen to tapes while you sleep.
As you hear New Age music a powerful message goes to your brain telling you to eat less.
Lose weight and listen to New Age music? Wow.
What do you think, Marge? Oh, Homer, I love you just the way you are.
Lisa, what's that number? I'd like to place an order for my husband.
Would he like to lose weight, stop smoking learn the state capitals, master hostage negotiations.
.
? Hmm hostage negotiations.
Listen, Tabbouleh, we're ignoring all your demands.
What do you say to that? Give me the weight loss tape.
We're out of ''Subliminally Slim.
'' Uh send them the vocabulary builder.
Here you go, fatso.
So long, stomach.
We've had a lot of great memories.
Hello.
This is Dr.
Marvin Monroe.
Let's build your vocabulary.
Abattoir: Slaughterhouse.
''The cow was slaughtered in the abattoir.
'' Has the weight loss tape reduced your appetite? Lamentably, no.
My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety.
Don't you usually play with Milhouse? He has a girlfriend.
Milhouse? Yeah.
All they do is kiss.
How cute.
They don't open their mouths, do they? No.
How cute.
Hey, Martin.
No one has sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by 20 minutes.
I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl.
I'm as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.
Yeah, right.
Do you want to do something after school? It's a date.
Everyone, Bart and I would like to announce that we friends.
Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute? Uh sure.
Is that tape working? You ate three desserts tonight.
Forbearance is the watchword.
That triumvirate of twinkies overwhelmed my resolve.
There's another thing I want to talk about.
Tut, tut, gentle Marge.
Here in the boudoir the gourmand metamorphosizes into the voluptuary! What in God's name are you talking about? Oh.
Mmm Heh Hey, guys.
Wow, that really took my mind off those awful, transforming space mutants.
Good.
Man, I could sure go for a snack.
Me too.
D'oh! Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't we go spit on the principal's car? Listen, Bart, there's such a thing as spending too much time together.
Oh, fine.
I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle.
There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out.
Bart, wait.
Yeah? Uh could we still use your tree house? What? Get bent.
If her father catches us, he'll kill her.
All right, Milhouse.
You can use my tree house.
Thanks, Bart.
Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree About to lose their privacy Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.
Ooh, a sextet of ale! Hello, Mr.
Stanky? I have shocking news about Samantha.
Who am I? Let's just say I'm concerned prude with lot of time on his hands.
I bet you had peanut butter for breakfast.
Yeah.
Samantha! Dad! Noooooo! Samantha, you're my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me.
Just tell me what happened.
Milhouse and I That's enough! I'm putting you in an all-girl school.
You're never going to see that boy again.
Milhouse! Samantha! Well, 'tis better to have loved and lost yatta, yatta, yatta.
Let's go to the arcade.
How could this happen? We started out like Romeo and Juliet but it ended up in tragedy.
Hierospacy: Predicting the future through the study of animal entrails.
Dad! Do you know what today is? The vernal equinox? No, it's two weeks since you got that weight-loss tape.
Let's get you on the scale.
You've gained 1 3 pounds.
Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery-- A pox on them! There stands a broken man.
It's recess everywhere but in his heart.
Hey, Bart, according to this magazine in another million years man will have an extra finger.
Five fingers? Ooh-- Freak show! Lise, I need some advice and mom's not here.
What about dad? I couldn't understand what he was saying.
I feel terrible.
I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know.
According to Eternity magazine the feeling of guilt has been linked to gamephenomene.
Dow Chemical is developing a minty gel to eliminate excess guilt but it won't be on the market for six months so I guess you'll have to confess to Milhouse.
Bart, I'm glad you're here.
Milhouse could use a friend like you.
Milhouse? Bart, I don't want you to see me cry.
Oh, come on.
You cry when they're out of chocolate milk.
You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over.
Well, I didn't want you to see me cry this time.
Milhouse, I got a confession to make.
I'm the one who narc'ed on your kissing.
What?! Milhouse is out bed and full beans.
Whoa, it's a miracle! I bet the eight ball didn't see that one coming.
Yeah.
Marge where's that metal dealie you use to dig food? You mean, a spoon? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh, this is good.
Are you sure you want to do this? I can't stop thinking about her.
Even these gates remind me of her braces.
How are we going to find her? She's wearing a plaid jumper.
Milhouse! Samantha! I went to Circus of Values and bought you a ten-gallon tub of gummi bears.
I'm sorry about getting you thrown in the penguin house.
That's all right, Bart.
I love Saint Sebastian's.
It's run by a group of French Canadian nuns.
They're very nice except they never let me out.
Samantha, ne pas des boys.
I have to go now, Milhouse.
I'd better not.
It's 50 rosaries a kiss.
Oh, okay.
Oh, what the heck.
Bart think I can ever find another one like her? You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse.
They all look alike to me.
Now, let's go whip donuts at old people.
- Shh!

##Ahh, the Simpsons ## D'oh! Forgot there was a physical today, huh? Yeah.
Hey, Homer, can I borrow your underwear? Nah.
This can't be right.
This man has 1 04% body fat.
Hey, no eating in the tank.
Go to hell.
How was your day at work, dear? Oh, the usual-- stand in front of this.
Open that.
Pull down this.
Bend over.
Spread apart that.
Turn your head that way.
Cough.
Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile.
Who? A cabbagehead from sector 7-G.
Take a look at this sperm sample.
Eww.
Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample.
Oh, yes.
I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason.
He could sue for millions.
Mother of pearl.
Call my lawyers! Let me make one thing clear.
I want your legal advice.
I even pay for it.
But to me, you're all vipers.
You live on personal injury, on divorces.
You live on pain and misery! But I'm rambling.
Anybody want coffee? I'll have coffee.
Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart.
It's so hard to listen.
I hate you all so much! I'm sorry.
It's my problem.
I'll deal with it.
Please continue.
If you offer Mr.
Simpson a couple thou he'll be so dazzled he'll sign anything you shove under his nose.
Oh, a cash settlement.
I could have figured that out, you buttoned-down maggot! You have cream? Yes.
Where are my manners? Yeah, I used to be rich.
I owned Mickey Mouse massage parlors.
Then those Disney sleazeballs shut me down.
I said, ''I'll change the logo-- put Mickey's pants on.
'' Some guys you just can't reason with.
I used to own a successful car company.
My strategy was giving them Japanese names.
You ever drive a Tempura hatchback? - Oh, yeah.
- Sure.
I got hit by one of those.
Yeah, life was sweet.
Then I found out I had a long-lost half brother.
Homer? Herb? I let him design a car that would make or break my company.
Presenting the Homer.
I'm ruined! Forbes called it:: Overblown, don't you think? What about New Coke? Hey! I invented that.
Yeah, but all that's in the past because this is America, and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain because all a man really needs is an idea.
- Well, I'm licked.
- Me too.
Now, the next event in our living room Olympics-- the controversial couch vault.
I do this for Stainmaster carpets proud sponsor of the living room Olympics.
What the hell are you.
.
? Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat-- The dream is over.
Who did this? We were sitting on the couch when we heard a creaking noise.
We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
There, there.
You're safe now, little sister.
Why did this have to happen now during prime time when TV's brightest stars come out to shine? Oh, good-bye, old girl.
We've had a lot of great memories.
That's right.
I shotJ.
R.
Except for huge gaps in the western states Hands Across America was a complete success.
Well, I never thought I'd see it.
They're dancing on the Berlin Wall.
These live and lively lovers of liberation Boring.
Sorry I ruined your date, Sergeant Carter.
Pyle! Well, friend, you're going back where you came from-- the curb in front of Flanders's house.
Now, let's see.
I need an idea.
Idea idea! What's the matter with me? I used to have hundreds of ideas.
What do you want? I just changed your diaper.
Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home? Lady, you just gave me the idea of a lifetime.
How do I thank you? Don't hurt me.
Consider it done.
Hey, pal, I heard about the couch.
Yeah, you going to be okay? Yeah.
You know, my life just can't get any worse.
That's right.
There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
Simpson, report to Mr.
Burns's office.
D'oh! Is this the one with the lazy sperm? Mm-hmm.
Ah, Simpson, you big, virile son of a gun would you like a check for $2,000? Would I! All you have to do is sign this form.
I'm not signing anything until I read it or somebody gives me the gist of it.
Ooh.
All right.
Well, it just explains that you've won--yes, that's it-- won the first annual Montgomery Burns uh Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence.
Don't I get some kind of trophy? And a big awards ceremony? Yes.
That was Bonita DeWolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft-shoe Society.
This is the biggest farce I ever saw.
What about the Emmys? I stand corrected.
And now, to present the award here's former heavyweight champion Smokin'Joe Frazier.
Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as ''the quality or condition of being excellent.
'' And now the winner of the first annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence.
Please, please You know you won.
Don't jinx it.
The winner: Homer Simpson.
Oh, my God! I win! Keep those pickled eggs coming.
You cleaned me out.
What's the matter, Homer? Cummerbund tight? I miss my couch.
I know how you feel.
You lost the couch.
I lost the heavyweight championship.
Heavyweight championship.
There's three of those.
That couch was one of a kind.
I know things are tough now but one day, you'll be walking along and see a piece of furniture you can love just as much.
Hey, Frazier, shut up! You been riding my back all night.
Oh, yeah? Care to step outside? Let's do it.
I think I'm going to take a walk.
All right! A peanut.
I'm telling you, all a man needs is an idea and I've got an idea.
Then how come you're still a bum? All right.
A man needs two things-- an idea and money to get it off the ground.
Hello, what's this? Hmm.
Any of you guys know which freight goes to Springfield? Uh-uh.
No.
No.
That's the one! I feel so empty, so alone, so couchless.
Wow! The Spinemelter 2000.
Give me full power.
But, sir Damn it! I said full power.
Dad? Dad? I'll take it.
This chair is $2,000.
We can buy a whole living room set for that.
There's an empty spot inside me.
I tried to fill it with family, religion community service, but those were dead ends.
I think this chair is the answer.
We can't just spend this money on some creature comfort.
All right, we won't get the chair.
Now excuse me while I kiss the sky.
Hmm Yes? Oh, sorry, I must have the wrong house.
That's where you're wrong, friend.
Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient.
Come in, my friend.
Let us feed and bathe you.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet? I think it's Mom's turn, son.
Oh, no fair.
Thanks for the suit.
If you ever want to spend the night Maude and I can sleep on card tables.
They're singing again.
Lousy neighbors.
Wish I was deaf.
What am I going to say? This is the guy who ruined me.
But on the other hand, he's family.
So many conflicting emotions.
How to express them? Herb? Uncky Herb! Bart! Lisa! I'm so glad to see you.
You weren't so glad to see me.
I'm sorry, but I'm still mad at you.
Every word you say makes me want to punch you.
In my home, could you just kick me in the butt? I'll try, but I'm not making any promises.
Herb! How have you been? I've been living in a cardboard box sleeping on grates, eating out of Dumpsters.
You? Can't complain.
Let me give you the grand tour.
This is one of our many light switches.
It functions in both the on and off mode.
On, off.
On, off.
He knows how to work a light switch.
Oh, yeah, right.
I don't know what this switch does.
This is really good, Marge.
I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Council.
They do good work.
Uncky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself? Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
Lisa, aren't you happy to see me? Why didn't you write? What would I say? '' Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop''? I see your point.
Maggie, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
You're going to make me rich again.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
One, two, three Ventnor Avenue.
And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa.
A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble.
There is the unpleasant matter of the bill.
Get to the point.
That's all I got.
Broke again, eh, Herb? Just like in real life.
I guess you're just not much of a businessman.
Maybe we should play another game.
Why are we playing games when we got two grand in the bank? Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award.
We should invest in a set of''Great Books of Western Civilization.
'' Look at this ad from New Republic for Kids.
'' Each month, a new classic will be delivered.
''Paradise Regained, Martin Chuzzlewit or Herman Melville's twin classics, Omoo and Typee.
'' Marge, didn't you want that vibrating chair? That was your idea.
We should get a machine gun.
We could hunt game, spell out things or ring in the new year.
I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer.
How would you like to spend $2,000 to give a broken man a second chance? Nah.
What are you talking about? Not here.
Come into the dining room.
I have a 20-minute presentation that will change the world.
Okay, now before I tell you about my idea I'd like to show you this.
It's drinking the water! Take it easy, Homer.
This is an example of how one little idea, carefully marketed-- This is the greatest invention in the world.
You'll make a million dollars.
No, that invention is out already.
I'm just using it as an example.
It's going back for more.
Oh Homer, this is my invention.
Now of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination.
What the-- Hmmm.
It's a baby translator.
It measures the pitch the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries.
Then it tells whoever's around in plain English exactly what the baby is trying to say.
Everything from ''change me'' to ''turn off that damn Raffi record.
'' That's a very clever idea.
All I need is a couple of thousand dollars to build a prototype.
You'll have your money back in 30 days, I swear.
We owe a debt to Uncky Herb.
He took us in and Dad destroyed him.
Some shyster will bilk you out of your money.
It may as well be your brother.
I'll lend you the 2,000 bucks but you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
No.
Then give me the drinking bird.
What could you be saying? Nothing downstairs.
You just took a nap.
''I want to suck your nose.
'' Hooga-booga, hooga-booga.
''I'm scared.
'' Hmm The amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for ''burp me'' and this sawtooth formation seems to Blah! Eureka.
Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet.
No.
We peeked while you were in the john.
Oh.
Well, here it is again my baby translator.
Ooh! Marge, you don't have to humor me.
Well, it's pretty ingrained.
What do you think, Homer? This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
I can't believe we blew 2,000 bucks on it when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.
Could you stop thinking about your ass? I try, but I can't.
Lavish attention on me and entertain me.
Oh, Maggie, you talked! You see? It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
Maggie.
Maggie.
Where did you go? Peekaboo! Oh, there you are.
Very amusing.
Homer, now what do you think? I don't know, Herb.
People are afraid of new things.
You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it.
Homer, every mother in the country will want one of these.
I have soiled myself.
How embarrassing.
I gave Herb all my money and he still treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
He can't stay mad at you forever.
He is your brother.
When is he going to act like it? This radio-controlled plane gives your baby the chance to fly just like my son here.
He can execute the barrel roll, the loop-the-loop and bring it in for the perfect landing.
Oh, dear.
My wife is going to kill me.
I only want to eat candy.
Then that's all you'll get.
This leash demeans us both.
I'll take two! I'll take a dozen! I represent the Precious Baby Discount Stores.
I'll take 50,000! I'm rich again! U.
S.
A.
! U.
S.
A.
! U.
S.
A.
! Homer here's a check for $2,000.
I also wanted to give you each something for believing in me.
Lisa, this is the first volume of''the Great Books of Western Civilization.
'' You'll receive a new one every month from Beowolf to Less Than Zero.
Finally a copy of Ethan Frome to call my own.
You're too young for that machine gun but I'm giving you something that will make sure when you're old enough you can still buy one a membership in the National Rifle Association.
Wow! The N.
R.
A.
! Can I get armor-piercing, cyanide-tipped bullets? It's in the Constitution.
Maggie who brought me my fortune I'll give you anything you want in this world.
I want what the dog's eating.
D'oh! I'll get you something nice.
Now, Marge Herb, I don't need any gift.
You're too late, Marge.
I got you a new washer and dryer and sold the old ones for 50 bucks.
- Come on, washer! Oh, you stupid dryer! Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me.
Homer, walk me to my car.
What do I get? It's not another punch in the face, is it? This is what you get, Homer.
I forgive you.
You can call me brother, and I can do the same.
That's it? That's it.
I see your point brother.
Give me a hug brother.
All right but I never really hugged a man before.
Homer, I bought you the damn chair.
Get out of here.
Go on, that's enough.
Get out of here.
Shh!

Yea! Here are your grades.
Oh, no, Mrs.

If I don't get a "C" average, my dad won't let me go to Kamp Krusty.
Well, it isn't fair to the other children, but all right.
- Much obliged, doll! - [ Laughing .]
Oh, Bart Simpson, I'm gonna miss you.
Attention, everyone.

I trust you all remembered to bring in your implements of destruction.

I dreamt it was the last day of school.
Well, it is.
Oh, how do I know this isn't Some beautiful dream too? Ow! You know, a pinch is more traditional.
[ Loud Gobbling, Belching .]
Homer, you do remember your promise to the children? Sure do! When you're 1 8, you're out the door! No, Dad, you promised if Bart and I got "C" averages, we could go to Kamp Krusty.
And with no false modesty, you're lookin' at one happy camper.
[ Nervous Chuckling .]
Yeah.
Remember, when you see my report card, they got this new grading system this year.
It now goes, "D," "B," "A," "C.
" Listen, boy, we have an understanding, and you'd better keep your end of it.
I don't think I'd be any kind of a father If you got D's, and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.
But, Dad! if you want something in this life, you have to work for it.
Now, quiet! They're about to announce the lottery numbers.

Ah, my gym shorts.
Here are your final report cards.
I have nothing left to say to any of you.
So if nobody minds, let's just quietly run out the clock.
[ Gasps .]
I've never gotten a "B" before.
How could this have happened? I feel so dirty! [ Grunting .]
The dirt's not coming off!.
[ Panting .]
Okay.
Calm down.
This must just be a little typo.
[ Nervous Giggle .]
Oh, Miss Hoover! There appears to be a mistake on my report card.
You gave me a B-plus in conduct? Now, Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record.
Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.
[ Hysterical Giggle .]
- I think you should reconsider.
- Lisa, you're hurting me! Mrs.
Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades I hope you'll note that all Of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition-- in some cases, still in their original wrappings.
Duly noted.
I'd also like to add, as I gaze upon your beauty I've never seen an angel fly so low.
Forget it, short pants.
Mrs.
Krabappel, if I don't get at least a "C" average I can't go to Kamp Krusty! Have a "D"-lightful summer! [ Laughing .]
- Five! - Four! - Three! - Two! - Don't open your mouth.
- One! - [Bell Ringing.]

Well, William, another school year gone by.
- And may I say, a job well done, sir? - Well, back to work then.
Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing.
We want the old girls sparkling when I get back.
Aye, sir.
Eh, you silk-wearing buttercup! All right! Three whole months Of Spaghetti Os and daytime TV! So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty? You bet.
Check out this hand.
All aces.
[ Laughing .]
A-plus! Oh, Bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades? [ Sighing .]
Oh! Hi, kids! Only one week left to sign up for the bestest summer ever at Kamp Krusty! [ Grunts, Laughing .]
Whoa! [ Laughing, Grunting .]
Hey! Kamp Krusty is built on an actual Indian burial ground.
We've got archery, wallet-making-- the whole megillah.
[Chortling.]
And for you fat kids my exclusive program of diet and ridicule will really get results.
And the best part is, when you come to Kamp Krusty you'll spend the summer with me! Honest Injun! [ Chortling .]
Well, here goes nothin'.
- [Clattering.]
- D'oh! Stupid roller skate.
Well, Dad, here's my report card.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
A-plus? - You don't think much of me, do you, boy? - No, sir.
You know, a "D" turns into a "B" so easily.
You just got greedy.
So I won't get to go to camp? Now, Bart, we made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades.
And you didn't.
But why should you pay for my mistake? - You mean I can go? - Yeah.
I didn't want you hanging around all summer anyway.
Oh, Dad, you're the best father a boy could ever have! Thanks, son.
Now, you've got little hands.
Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate? - [ Engine Starts .]
- Phew.
Never mind.
[ Humming .]
Bart, where's your bathing suit? - I'm gonna swim "nekkid.
" - You're what? Ah, sure, there'll be a couple Of up-tight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty.
Marge, am I crazy or is my back getting hairier? Before I go to camp, I'll need boosters for malaria German measles, encephalitis, Hansen's disease-- Oh, now, I'm afraid what we have here is an advanced case of hypochondria.
There's only one known cure-- a "wowwipop.
" [ Chuckling .]
Don't patronize me, Doctor.
It's our last family dinner for six weeks but I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

We'll see you when you get back from Image Enhancement Camp.

It's fat camp for Daddy's chubby little secret! You promised you wouldn't make a scene.

I'll see you in a few weeks.
Until then, I've turned things over to my bestest buddy in the whole wide world-- [ Dubbed Voice .]

Thank you, Krusty, and welcome, children.
I am Mr.

I'll take any questions you might have.
You, and then one more.
- Can we call you Uncle Blackie? - No.
Last question.
- When do we get to see Krusty? - Uh, he will be along eventually.
In the meantime, our counselors Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney will be happy to handle any problems you may have.

Uh, all this stuff is fine.

We're doing great.
Your father is in the best shape he's been since-- well, ever! [ Grunts .]
Strength! Agility! [Marge's Voice.]
We miss you terribly.
I hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home.
Hey, Simpson! Tell your mom her cookies sucked.

Dear Mom and Dad, I no longer fear hell because I've been to Kamp Krusty.
Our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
[ Groans .]
- A snake bit me.
- Back in line, maggot! [Lisa.]
Our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a Dickensian workhouse.
Come on, wimps! These Gucci wallets have to be on the streets of Hong Kong by Friday.
[Lisa.]
Bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that Krusty the Clown will come through.
Krusty is coming.
Krusty is coming.
Krusty's coming.
But I am far more pessimistic.
I am not sure If this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut.
Giddyap! Now the effort of writing Has made me lightheaded so I close by saying, "Save us! Save us now!'" - Bart and Lisa.
- [ Chuckling .]
Ah, kids' letters from camp.
Oh, she complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave.
[Wind Howling.]

Lisa, I've been thinking it over.
Next summer, I'm getting a job.
[ Moaning .]
Oh, Homer.
It's getting late.
We'll miss the fireworks.
Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here.
Well, kids, I promised you a little treat in lieu of dinner and here it is-- the man who took an abandoned mule tannery and turned it into a summer wonderland Mr.
Krusty the Clown.
See? I told you Krusty would come.
just like I said.
He's gonna bring us food and water, and smite our enemies! [ Flies Buzzing .]
Now, I must tell you kids, Krusty has laryngitis and a bad back so he won't be saying anything or doing anything.
Krusty looks fat.
He's really having trouble keeping his balance.
He's still funny, but not ha-ha funny.
- That's not Krusty the Clown! - [ Kids Gasping .]
What do you think? I slapped a clown suit on some wino? - [ Nervous Laughing .]
I mean, I-- - Yeah, Bart.
I am so Krunchy the Clown! [ Belches .]
All right.
That's it.
I've been scorched by Krusty before.
I got a rapid heartbeat from those Krusty Brand vitamins.
My Krusty calculator didn't have a seven or an eight! And Krusty's autobiography was self-serving with many glaring omissions.
But this time, he's gone too far! We want Krusty! We want Krusty! We want Krusty! Yeah, we want Krunchy! We want Krunchy! - I thought you said you broke their spirits.
- We did.
- You broke nothing.
- [ Bart .]

Three counselors are missing and presumed scared.
What's that? I'm being told I can have an exclusive interview with the ringleader.
[ Thinking .]
Don't be the boy.
Don't be the boy.
D'oh! I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp.
- Can I say "crappy" on TV? - Yes, on this network, you can.
Is it true you attempted suicide when you heard the news? - Are you and Princess Di just friends? - You people make me sick! You're vultures! Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid? Out of my way, you parasites! I said, out of my way! I'm no fake.
I'm the real Krusty.
Oh, yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom President Clown? I don't know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year.
I smell bacon.
Let's see if he's wearing a wire! - Hey! Whoa! No! Not the face! - [ Gasping .]
[Lisa.]
It is the real Krusty.
Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark and his famous superfluous nipple.
At least you're not as bad as Customs.
How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product.
[ Loud Sobbing .]
Oh! They drove a dump truck full Of money up to my house.
I'm not made of stone! Krusty, this camp was a nightmare.
They fed us gruel.
They forced us to make wallets for export.
And one of the campers was eaten by a bear.
Oh, my God! [ Sobbing .]
- Well, actually, the bear just ate his hat.
- Was it a nice hat? - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna make it up to you.

Simpson, I don't like to toot my own horn but we're the only day care center in town that's not currently under investigation by the state.
Oh.
Well, be a good girl, Maggie.
I'm sorry, Maggie.
We don't allow these here.
You're a dame and I'm a fella Stanley, stop or I'll tell Stella Passion, Mrs.
Simpson.

- This man disgusts you! - #All I want is one embrace # I'll twist this bottle in your face Mm.
Mm.
Mm! [ Chuckles .]
Here, Marge, let me.
Hate to be an armchair Blanche but I always gave it one of these-- - There.
There's the ol' face-shredder.
- Oh.
Mrs.
Simpson, if you set out to push the bile to the tip of my throat mission accomplished! I'm, uh-- I'm gonna crawl into bed with a bottle of amaretto.
Good day.
[ Homer.]
Easy, easy.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes-- D'oh! [ Electronic Voice .]
Homer, can you run some lines with me? - Make Bart do it.
- It'll just take a sec.
- Gutter ball! - D'oh! You see, Marge, while you're Off in your own little world you forgot that other people have problems too.

Don't like to nap, eh? We have a place for babies like you-- the box! All right, let "ham-ateur" night in Dixie commence.
I'm sorry, Llewellyn, I just-- I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face.
Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humor? Marge, your ride's here.
Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more! You're a dame and I'm a fella Stanley, stop or I'll tell Stella Marge.
Marge! I'm asking For white-hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit.
Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine? - Oh, here! - [ Clattering .]
Hey, there's some quarters in here.
I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.
[ Grunting .]
Stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud.
Marge, every second you spend with this man he is crushing your fragile spirit.
You can't let that happen.
[Yelling.]
Whoo-hoo! Come to papa.
Marge, I'll be out in the car.
All I want is one embrace - [Car Horn Honking.]
- Marge, move it or lose it.
I'll twist this bottle in your face Aaah! Hallelujah! I've done it again! Ned, you're supposed to overpower her.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
[ Straining .]
- Salt me.
- [ Southern Accent .]
Here you are, Homer.
What the-- Why are you talking like that? The play's tomorrow night.
[ With Accent .]
I've got to stay in character.
- [ With Accent .]
Would it help if I talked like this too? - It might.
[ Cockney Accent .]
An' I'll talk like 'is.
Bob's yer uncle, mate.
That really doesn't help, Bart.
Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a lil' ol' biscuit? Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.
I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock! Oh, see you later, kids.
I've got to go rehearse with Ned.
But, Marge, what about dessert? For God's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding! Fine.
I will! [ Screeches .]
Oh, no.
My pudding is trapped forever! So I can open my own can Of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge.
Marge! Hey, Marge! Keep yelling, you big ape.
Aren't you being a little hard on old Homie? Oh, forget about him.
Let's rehearse the bottle scene.
Oh! Let's not and say we did.
Hmm? - [ Muttering Lines .]
- So, what time does this play start? - Why? Are you going? - Well, I gotta go, don't I? I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
There's nothing about bowling in the play.
- Oh, wait, there is.
- Probably not much of it.
Why can't you be a little more supportive? 'Cause I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.
- What "kooky projects"? - You know, the painting class the first aid course, the whole Lamaze thing.
Why didn't you tell me you felt this way? You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings.
Good night.

I wasn't bored.
I was sad.
It really got to me how that lady, uh, um-- - You know which one I mean.
You played her.
- Blanche.
Yeah.
How Blanche was sad.
And how that guy Stanley should have been nice to her.
Yeah? Go on.
I mean, it made me feel bad.
The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nuthouse when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect.
Well, at least that's what I thought.
I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
No, Homer, you got it just right.
Hey, you know, I'm a lot like that guy.

Oh, doctor.
A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63.
We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today three visits from Morganna the Kissing Bandit and the astonishing return of Jim Brown.
Whoo-hoo! Is that what I think it is? Mm-hmm.
I found a penny! Could this be the best day of my life? [ Laughing .]
Looks like we have a new champion.
Ah, my beloved family.
- How was church? - [ Muttering .]
[ Snorting .]
I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life and I owe it all to skipping church.
That's a terrible thing to say! Kids, your father doesn't really mean that.
Like fun I don't.
Marge, I'm never going to church again! Homer, are you actually giving up your faith? No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, yes.
I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer.
Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? - I mean, isn't God everywhere? - Amen, brother.
And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week? - Tell it, Daddy.
- And what if we pick the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
Testify! [ Groaning .]
Lord, my husband is by no means perfect but he's a kind, decent man.
Please show him the error of his ways.
Marge, come to bed.
No, Homer.
He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord.
He just likes to sleep in on Sundays.
Marge.
Come to bed, Marge.
[ Whispering .]
Lord, please.
He's not a bad person, Lord, really.
- It's good for what ails ya.

God? Thou has forsaken my church! - Well, kind of, but-- - But what? I'm not a bad guy.
I work hard and I love my kids.
So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell? Hmm, you've got a point there.
You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football.
Does St.
Louis still have a team? - No, they moved to Phoenix.
- Oh, yeah.
You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
Oh, I couldn't agree more.
That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me.
I think I'll give him a canker sore.
- Give him one for me.
- I will.
- So I figure I should just try to live right-- - [ Purring .]
and worship you in my own way.
Homer, it's a deal.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico.
- Dad, can I ask you a question? - Sure, honey.
Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy? Don't worry, sweetheart.
If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.
Hello, my animal friends.
Peace be with you.
Guys, please, could you give me five minutes? Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit Of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner.
- [ Shouts .]
What? - No, it's nothing bad.
I'm just concerned because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.
Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing but then God himself told me I should seek a new path.
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
He appeared before me in a dream and I knew that was special because I usually dream about naked Marge.
- [ Groans .]
- So, Homer, you saw the big cheese? - What'd he look like? - Perfect teeth, nice smell, a class act all the way.
Homer, you're crazy! Tell him this is all crazy.
Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26.
The foolish man who built his house on sand.
And you remember Matthew 21 :1 7.
"And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany and he lodged there"? Yeah.
Think about it.
Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson.
I won't be coming in tomorrow.
Religious holiday.

- Pretty slick.
- You should join my religion, Moe.
It's great.

I have a responsibility to raise these children right.
And unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is well, wicked.
Kids, let me tell you about another so-called "wicked" guy.
He had long hair and some wild ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right.
And that man's name was-- I forget.
But the point is-- I forget that too.
Marge, you know who I'm talking about.
- He used to drive that blue car.
- Kids, could you wait outside for us? Homer, please don't make me choose between my man and my god because you just can't win.
There you go again.
Always taking someone else's side-- Flanders, the water department, God.
I'm only going to ask you one last time.
Are you sure you won't come with us to church? [ Man On TV.]

- Well, bless you any-- Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy! Apu, I see you're not in church.
Oh, but I am.
I have a shrine to Ganesha the god of worldly wisdom located in the employee lounge.
- Hey, Ganesha, want a peanut? - Please do not offer my god a peanut.
No offense, Apu, but when they were handing out religions you must've been out taking a whiz.

The Lord is vengeful.
O Spiteful One, show me who to smite, and they shall be "smoten.

No, but he was working in the hearts Of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid be they Christian, Jew or miscellaneous.
Hindu.
There are - Aw, that's super.
- I was rude to every one of you.
And you saved my life when you could have just left me to fry like the proverbial pancake that I am.
Oh, Homey, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
Now, would you give church another try? I'll be there next Sunday, front row, center.
[ Snoring Loudly.]

Don't feel bad, Homer.
Nine out often religions fail in their first year.
That's game, Hendrix! God, I gotta ask you something.
What's the meaning of life? Homer, I can't tell you that.
- Come on.
- You'll find out when you die.
- I can't wait that long.
- You can't wait six months? No, tell me now.

Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba! [ Panting .]
[ Howling .]
Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl.
You're looking at her through a father's eyes.
Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would.
- But to me, she's beautiful.
- That is so sweet.
Honey, no one's going to force you to do anything.
But do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant? - Nope.
- He sold his ride on the Duff blimp.
But that ride meant everything to him! [ Singing Sadly.]
I'll do it.
- Did you see Tina Epstein? - Whoa! If you're gonna binge, you'd better purge.
Uh-oh.
- Amber Dempsey.
- In the same week she was Pork Princess and Little Miss Kosher.
- She's beautiful.
- Wait.
She's about to bring out the big guns.
- Eyelash implants.
- I thought those were illegal.
Not in Paraguay.
There's no way I can beat this girl.
She's the Jack Nicklaus Of the pageant circuit.
Oh, I don't know that she's as attractive as Jack Nicklaus.
[ Humming .]
I meant because they both win all the time, Mom.
Oh.
Well, yes.
That's what I meant too.
Well, tell you what.
This afternoon I'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be.
And later, I'll teach you the tricks of the trade-- taping your swimsuit to your butt petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile and the ancient art of padding.
[ Purring .]
- Are we done? - We are just warming up.
Oh, isn't this dangerous? Don't worry.
I am well protected.
Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.
She'll see through me like Grandma's underpants.
No, she won't.
When it comes to compliments women are ravenous, bloodsucking monsters always wanting more, more, more! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return.
- Like what? - I'll tell you when you're older.
- [ Chuckling .]
- [Door Slams Shut.]
[ Gasps .]
Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven.
There's an angel missing.
And who's your little school friend? Wait a minute.
That's Mom! - Oh, my goodness! How gallant! - Isn't that nice? Thank you.
I know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
- Hey, hey! - Whoo-hoo! - Dad, you know anything else about women? - Nope, that's it.
Hey, brush-head, you've been nursing that thing for an hour.
You know, I was just wondering how someone who works at an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure.
I've misjudged you.
[ Piano .]
[ Piano .]
I said step, pause, turn, pause, pivot, step, step not step, pause, turn, pause, pivot, step, pause! Ooh! Shudder! And the winner is Lisa Simpson! - [ Gasps .]
- Okay, wipe away a tear.
Hug the loser.
And now, for your triumphant walk down the runway.
Whoa! Ooh! Aah! It's hopeless! There's nothin' to it.
Give me those heels.
Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
Hmm.
Do you really think I can win? Hey, I'm starting to think I can win.
But those other girls are prettier than me.
Lise, as your brother this is the hardest thing I've every had to say.
- You're not ugly.
- Oh, Bart! [Up-tempo.]
[ Talking Over Music .]
Out on our own! Making it work! Gasping for air! Having it all! My name is Amber Dempsey, and when I grow up I want to be a sweetie pie.
[Applause.]
I am Pahasatira Nahasapeemapetilon and tonight I will be playing "Mac Arthur Park" on the tabla.
[ Laughing .]
No, I am serious.
Yes! Judges, there's your queen.
- Who's watching the Kwik-E-Mart? - [ Both Gasp .]
- [ Grunting .]
- [ Laughing .]
My name is Lisa Simpson, and I want to be Little Miss Springfield so I can make our town a better place! Yeah! Clean up this stink-hole! [ Panting, Grunts .]
Krusty! About time you got here.
Yeah, yeah.
What is this-- the, uh, Republican fund-raiser? Checking it out! Hitting the heights! Making a wish! Dreaming a dream! [ Singing .]
- [ All .]
Me! - ####[Ends.]
Oh, that brisket's not sittin' right.
[ Singing .]
[ Snoring .]
Oh, that just kept goin', huh? And now here's Lisa Simpson! They'll love you just as much as I do.
Thanks, Dad.
Mmm.
Some people say that to love your country is old-fashioned uncool, real melvin.
Well, to them I say-- [ Singing Patriotic Song .]
One, two, three, four! ## [ Singing Rock And Roll Song.]
[ Cheering .]
This is my favorite part Of the pageant, because-- What does that say? Oh.
It gives me a chance to visit with the girls personality.
Uh, personally.
Amber, do you think the Bill of Rights is a good thing or a bad thing? - Um-- - Take your time, dear.
Good thing.
[ All Fawning .]
And now it's time to name our runner-up who, if the winner doesn't fulfill her duties-- [ Muttering Incoherently.]
And don't say it'll never happen because we all remember that thing with what's-her-name.
Click, click.
You know.
Okay, the runner-up is [ Groans .]
- [Cymbal Crash.]
- Lisa Simpson! Which means Amber Dempsey is the new Little Miss Springfield! [Applause.]
[Orchestra.]
[ Singing .]
Coming up next, a new fad that's sweeping the nation-- wasting food.
But first, let's join the new Little Miss Springfield, Amber Dempsey as she helps open the Danish super-chain "Shop.
" Scott, everyone is here from the mayor's illegitimate son to our own Duff blimp.
- Hi.
Can I drive? - Well, I can't see the harm.
[Barney Yelling.]
Oh, the humanity! Anyway to turn on the store's "severe tire damage" spikes, here's Little Miss Springfield.
[Fanfare.]
Oh, dear.
It would be a shame If that pretty dress got wet.
I'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod.
Unless it's made out of plastic.
- [ Thunderclap .]
- Nope.
Metal.
Ladies and gentlemen, Little Miss Springfield has been struck by lightning.
[Man.]
Doctor, what is Amber's condition? Oh, she'll be fine.
In fact she's already won the Little Miss Intensive Care Pageant.
Congratulations, Lisa.
You're the new Little Miss Springfield.
Here's your scepter.
Oop! [ Laughing .]
just kidding.
Here you go.
Oop! [ Laughing .]
just kidding.
[ Yelling .]
I deserved that.
That doesn't look like her body.
The torso used to be Dr.
Ruth.
Her head is on a pike in the Chamber of Horrors.
[Wolf Howling.]
- [Wolf Whistles.]
- Hi, fellas.
Love that "chewing gum" walk.
Very Wrigley.
As Little Miss Springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to America the land of opportunity.
Actually, they're being deported.
[ Minor Key.]
[Man Over P.
A.
.]
And now, let's give a big Fort Springfield welcome to Mr.
Bob Hope! - What's the mayor's name? - Quimby.
Beautiful.
[Orchestra.]
Hello, this is Bob "What the hell am I doing in Springfield" Hope.
- ####[Ends.]
- Hey, how about that Mayor Quimby? He's some golfer! His golfball spends more time underwater than Greg Louganis.
[ Howling Laughter.]
And now, I wanna show you what you're fighting for, if there was a war on.
Little Miss Springfield.
- Isn't she beautiful? - Little Miss Springfield? First, Tony Randall cancels.
Now this.
- [ Yelling, Shouting .]
- Hey, what gives here? This is bogus! Hey! Where do you think you're goin'? We want Miss Springfield! Hey, set me down at that boat show.
I'm gonna be riding on a pack of cigarettes? Mm-hmm.
We think you're the perfect spokesmodel for Laramies.
It's part of our new campaign.
Mmm, classy.
[ Gasps .]
You see, Lisa, it's been an unlucky year for Laramie.
A lot of the people who smoke our product have been well, dying.
And we need young smokers to take their place.
I don't wanna be a spokesperson for a cigarette company! But you're a role model To young people.
And we're thinking of retiring Menthol Moose.
[ Coughs, Spits .]
Bless you, boys.
- Homer, those are ice cream men.
- I know.
[ Gasps .]
- Stop this float! - [ Tires Screech .]
- What's the holdup? Go! - I'm tired of being a corporate shill.
[ Grunts .]
From now on, I will speak out against the evils in society from dog-napping to cigarettes.
[Lisa.]
Before I sing the national anthem I'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts.
- Is that true? - Let's get 'em! [ Grunting .]
Let's get out of here! [ Grunting Continues .]
Gentlemen, we need to get Lisa Simpson out and Amber Dempsey back in.
But this glorified, crossing-guard-of-a-police Chief won't get off his big fat can.
Is it okay if I open these potato chips? - [ Groans .]
- Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered.
Take a look at our Little Miss Springfield's pageant application.
Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne.
Yeah, and some dip for these chips or somethin'.
Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss Springfield.
She was stripped of her crown in a ceremony earlier today.
Well, that's obviously the wrong footage.
Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson filled out the pageant application incorrectly.
In the area under "Do not write in this space," he wrote, "Okay.
" If it wasn't for me, you'd still be queen.
- You must hate me.
- Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant? - I don't know.
Was I drunk? - Possibly.
But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself, and I do.
- Really? - Uh-huh.
Will you remember this the next time I wreck your life? It's a deal.
And now, my exclusive interview with His Holiness, Pope John Paul I.
That's it.
I cannot work under these conditions.
If anybody wants me, I'll be downstairs at McDougal's.
Call the weekend guy.
I don't care.
[Door Slams Shut.]
- [ People Chattering .]
- Shh!

[Somber.]
Good evening.
I've been asked to tell you that the following show is very scary with stuff that might give your kids nightmares.
You see, there are some crybabies out there-- religious types mostly-- who might be offended.
If you are one of them, I advise you to turn off your set now.
Come on.
I dare ya.
[ Clucking .]
Chicken.
- Hey.
- [Footsteps.]
[Marge.]
Homer, did you just call everyone "chicken'"? [Homer.]
No.
I swear on this Bible.
That's not a Bible.
That's a book of carpet samples.
Ooh, fuzzy.
[Thunderclap.]
[Sinister Laugh.]
[Woman Screams.]
[ Maggie Sucking .]
[Chattering.]
Behold mighty Caesar in all his glory! [ All Laughing .]
D'oh! I am Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry.
No kiddin'.
[ Groaning .]
Stupid party.
Wish we was trick-or-treating.
Now, Bart, you can find just as much horror around the house.
Now, you children may not know it but there was once an evil witch and she died a horrible death.
- These are her eyes.
- [Children.]
Eww! And this is her hair.
- [Children.]
Eww! - And these are her brains.
Eww! Yo, Mom.
We haven't got the eyeballs yet.
Homer, you're ruining it.
Yeah, well, it was an evil game.
Well, now we need another Halloween activity.
Hmm.
Does anyone know a ghost story? I do.
It's a story Of a boy and his doll.
- That's not so scary.
- A doll from hell! - I'm gonna go to the store.
- [ Sinister Laugh .]
[Grampa.]
Happy birthday, Bart.
Thanks, Grampa.
- Where'd you get all the money? - The government.
I didn't earn it.
I don't need it.
But if they miss one payment, I'll raise hell! Hey, Homer, where's your present? D'oh! I mean, don't worry, son.
I forgot to get you a present.
But I swear on my father's grave-- - Hey! - I will get you one now.
- [Door Opens.]
- [Tires Squeal.]
[Floor Creaking.]
Do you sell toys? We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread.
We also sell frozen yogurt, which I call frogurt.
Well, I need something for my son's birthday.
Uh, perhaps this will please the gentleman.
[Heart Beating.]
Take this object.
But beware-- it carries a terrible curse.
- Ooh, that's bad.
- But it comes with a free frogurt.
- That's good.
- The frogurt is also cursed.
- That's bad.
- But you get your choice of topping.
- That's good! - The toppings contain potassium benzoate.
- That's bad.
- Can I go now? [ Cheering .]
-[Thud, Groan.]
- Happy birthday, son.
Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll! I'm Krusty the Clown, and I love you very much.
Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had.
That doll is evil, I tells ya.
Evil! E-E-Evil! Grampa, you said that about all the presents.
I just want attention.
[ Man On TV.]
And in environmental news scientists have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly.
Whoo-hoo! I'm Krusty the Clown, and I don't like you.
[ Laughs .]
I'm Krusty the Clown, and I'm going to kill you.
[ Chuckles .]
Didn't even pull the string that time.
I said I'm going to kill you.
You, Homer Simpson.
Oh, yeah? With what? - Aah! - [ Screams .]
Homer, what's wrong? [ Whimpering .]
That doll tried to kill me.
I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure? Don't leave me alone with him.
[ Sinister Laugh .]
[ Sinister Laugh Continues .]
[ Singing .]
- [ Screams .]
- [Doll.]
Scram! [ Screaming .]
There goes the last lingering thread Of my heterosexuality.
Hey, baby, get comfortable.
Relax.
It's a little hot for that cheerleader outfit, don't you think? [Foot steps Approaching.]
[ Grunts .]
You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well, they are making me dizzy.
[Groans.]
- [Wolf Howls.]
- [Footsteps.]
Good-bye, dolly.
Arrivederci, Vito.
I was a fool to think anyone would want Nude photos of Whoopi Goldberg.
What the-- - [Tires Skid.]
- And that is that.
[ Groans, Grunts .]
- [Rustling.]
- Guess who, fat boy! - Marge! Marge, look! - Oh, my God! The doll's trying to kill me, and the toaster's been laughing at me.
[ Gurgling .]
Eww! Dog water.
[Touch-tones Beeping.]
- [ Line Ringing .]
- Your doll is trying to kill my husband! Yes, I'll hold.
[ Man Singing On Phone .]
[ Homer Groaning .]
Yep, here's your problem.
Someone set this thing to "evil.
" - I love you, Homer.
- Come here, you! [Straining.]
- Here you go, buddy.
- Did you walk the dog? Yeah, he buried me a couple of times.
Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk.
Yeah, you stupid idiot.
Oh, what a day.
Homer made me give him a sponge bath.
[ Shudders .]
But coming home to you makes it all worthwhile.
[ Kisses, Chuckles .]
Here, let me get that for you.
[Up-tempo.]
So then his wife comes through the door! - So? - Did I mention she was dead? - No.
- Well, she was.
And she hit him in the head with a golf club.
- And? - Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time, and it really bugged her.
- You said he went bowling.
- D'oh! Homer, I've coughed up scarier stuff than that.
Grampa, why don't you tell us a story? You've led an interesting life.
That's a lie, and you know it! But I have seen a lot of movies.
My name is Marge Bouvier.
I'm here about your ad.
"Single white female wanted for mysterious expedition.
Must like monkeys.
Nonsmoker preferred.
" Well, you'd be a welcome change of pace from the rest of these crude and uncouth sailors.
- Arr!Arr!Arr! - Arr!Arr!Arr! - What do you think, Smithers? - I think women and seamen don't mix.
We know what you think.
Young lady, you're hired.
[ Sinister Laugh .]
Hey, I heard we're going to Ape Island.
Yeah, to capture a giant ape.
I wish we were going to Candy Apple Island.
Candy Apple Island? What do they got there? Apes, but they're not so big.
[Chanting.]
Homer! Homer! Homer! Hey, who's this Homer dude? He's either a 50-foot prehistoric ape or a tourist trap concocted by the Ape Island Jaycees.
- Either way, we're going ashore.
- Am I going too? Of course.
We wouldn't think Of going without the bait.
Uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty.
The bathing beauty.
[ Chuckles .]
I covered that up pretty well.
- [Chanting Continues.]
Homer!Homer!Homer! - [Drums Beating.]
Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! [Mr.

Just try to remain inconspicuous.

Smithers, this is a golden opportunity.
If we get him alive, we can put him on Broadway.
Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the army.
[ Chuckles .]
Ooh! Keep your hands To yourself, mister.
[ Sniffs, Trills .]
- [ Giggles .]

- Oh, well.
[Broadway.]
- [Applause.]
- [ Roars .]
What kind of show you got for us, Mr.
Burns? Well, the ape's going to stand around for three hours or so.
Then we'll close with the ethnic comedy Of Dugan and Dershowitz.
Sensational! - [Drumroll.]
- Ladies and gentlemen in his native land, he was a king.
But he comes before you in chains For your own amusement.
Presenting Homer-- the Eighth Wonder of the World! [ Audience Gasps .]

You know, you look a little flushed.
Maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people.
Uh-huh.
[ Panting .]
[ Yells .]
[ Groaning .]
He's not dead! No, but his career is.
I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler Building.
After that, he couldn't get arrested in this town.

Don't worry, Homie.
I'll take care of you.

Are you with the bride or groom? [ Chittering .]

Hey, hi, fellow Halloweenies.
Did I scaredely-dareya? [ Yelling, Groaning .]
Dag-- darn it! Nice try, Mr.

- Too late.
From "A" apple to "Z" zebra Baby's First Pop-up Book is 26 pages of alphabetic adventure.
Bart, you mean to tell me you read a book intended for preschoolers? - Well, most of it.

Don't you remember that Snowball I died four years ago tonight? Run over by the mayor's beer-swilling brother, Clovis.

Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sure Bart doesn't really mean to be bad.
- [ Snoring .]
- Now's our chance to be bad.
[ Chuckles .]
Mr.
Simpson, I just wanted to tell you that you've done a wonderful job with Lisa.
- You must have read to her at a young age.
- I did.
I did read to her.
"8:00.
Happy Days.
"The Fonz, Henry Winkler is worried he's losing his cool.
" Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three "Rs"-- reading TV Guide, um writing to TV Guide and renewing TV Guide.
Now, we don't usually do this, but we have some witnesses.
Come in, Arthur.
Now, where did Bart stick the fireworks? - [ Gasps .]
- [ Snoring .]
Over the lips and past the gums-- look out dentures, here I come.
- Ew! - [ Growls .]
- [ Chuckles .]
- [ Growls .]
"My child is on the honor roll at Springfield Elementary.
" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my "Where's the Beef?" bumper sticker.
[ Chuckles .]
"Where's the Beef?" Uh, we'd like the desk back, Mr.
Simpson.
Huh? [ Chuckles .]
Oh.
[ Lively.]
Yaah! I really don't see how this helps Bart.
-Just do it.
- [ Groans .]
- Busted! - Homer, we have a problem here.
Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect.
I won't stand here and listen To you bad-mouthing Lisa! - We're talking about Bart! - Oh.
That guy.
I think the problem here is discipline.
- If Bart does something wrong, you should punish him.
- Well, we try.
But he has this way ofmaking us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.
- He's the boy you love to hate.
- Well, you've got to start being firm with him.
I believe, with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming, oh, say chief justice of the Supreme Court.
Chief justice Of the Supreme Court.
What great men he would join-- john Marshall Charles Evans Hughes, Warren Berger-- Mmm, burger.
- And what if we don't? - Then there's no telling how low he can sink.
[Man.]
All right, ladies.
Prepare to be blownaway By Bang Bang Bart.
- #### [Dance.]
- [ Pistols Firing .]
[ All Booing .]
- You're fat! -Just more of me to love, honey.
- [ Booing Continues .]
- [ Groaning .]
Oh! My poor baby! [Car Tires Screech.]
- [Car Doors Shut.]
- Uh-oh.
What? What's that? - Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Home already? - [ Muttering .]
Boy, time really flies when you're reading-- The Bible? Ew.
- Well, we brought some pizza.
- [ Exclaiming, Indistinct .]
If you don't start making more sense, we're gonna have to put you in a home.
You already put me in a home.
Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on 60Minutes.
I'll be good.
Look what your bad egg Of a son did to my teeth! Dad, you and your stories.
"Bart broke my teeth.
" "The nurses are stealing my money.
" "This thing on my neck is getting bigger.
" Now, this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about.
Our son did something wrong, and you look the other way.
But, Marge, look at that hangdog expression.
He's learned his lesson.
- Let's get him a present.
- [ Groans .]
- Please, Homer.
Why do I always have to be the bad guy? - All right, all right.
Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth, he gets to break yours.
Oh, this is gonna be sweet.
- No, no, no! - Ohh.
Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper.
Yeah, right.
Like you're gonna let me go hungry.
I'll be eating that pizza in five minutes.
- Bart, stop being confident.
- [Grampa.]
Doggoneit! - Ohh.
- Oh, Grampa.
I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food quick! - I'm a-comin', boy! - [Marge.]
Homer, get back here! There must be something to eat around here.
- [ Whimpering .]
- Hmm.
- [ Panting .]
- [ Yelps .]
Gee, maybe they mean it this time.
- From now on, I guess I'd better straighten up and fly-- - [Homer.]
Bart.
Don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.
just promise me you'll try to be good.
- I promise.
- That-a-boy.
[ Chuckling .]
Sucker.
- [ Pistol Cocks .]
- Well, well.
If it isn't the tooth fairy.
[ Man .]
Coming for Christmas, The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.
[ Laughing Maniacally.]
[ Gasps .]
Bart! Stick around, Mr.
Bond.
Things are really starting to cook.
[Chuckling Evilly.]
[Lisa.]
Bart, come quick! There's an Itchy and Scratchy movie! [ Gasps .]
[ Man .]
If you want suspense-- [ Screaming .]
romance-- Mmm! you'll find it in The Itchy and Scratchy Movie coming soon to a theater near you.
- Fifty-three percent new footage.
- Wow.
- Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked? - Indeed I did.
-[Goats Bleating.]
- D'oh! - Hey, you goats get out of here! - [ Hissing .]
Boy, you're gonna have to be punished for this.
Dad, you could punish me.
But that means you have to think of a punishment sit here and make sure I do it-- - Ohh.
- Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
Â¡Ay, elestÃ³mago! [ Chuckles .]
Run along, you little scamp.
- [ Gasps .]
- Huh? [ Chuckling .]
[Singing.]
Bart! Why are you doing that? - I don't know.
- Well, this time you must be punished! Well, you could punish me, but-- No tricks, boy.
I said I'm gonna punish you.
And come hell or high water, I-- - ####[Faint.]
- Wait a minute! [ Gasps .]
Ice cream truck! [ All Clamoring .]
Me! Me! I was here first! Mmm.
Now, what were we talking about, boy? Uh, we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Oh, yeah.
The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
- We're home! - We got beets! - Bart, are you pulling up the carpet? - Uh-huh.
- Why are you letting him do this? - I don't know.
- Well, punish him.
- All right, all right.
Bart, go toyour room.
See you in the funny pages.
- How could you let this happen? - How could you let this happen? - I wasn't here.
- Oh, how convenient.
Homer, do you want your son to become Chief justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper? Can't he be both, like the late Earl Warren? - Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
- Now who's being naive? - Look, you have to help discipline your son.
- All right, Marge.
I swear to you-- the next time he does something wrong, I'll punish him and make it stick.
[ Kent Brockman .]
Tonight on Eye on Springfield we meet a man who's been hiccupping for 45 years.
[ Hiccups .]
Kill me.
[ Hiccups .]
Kill me.
But first, we'll examine the growing Itchy and Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today.
I got my ticket.
[ Kent Brockman .]
I'm here live in Korea to give you a firsthand look at how American cartoons are made.
But first, let's take a look back at the year 1 928 a year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole.
[ Fast Jazz .]
Yaah! It was also the year Of the very first Scratchy cartoon entitled "That Happy Cat.
" [ Orchestra .]
[ Whistling Along .]
The film did very poorly.
But the following year, Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy and cartoon history was made.
Here's their first cartoon together-- "Steamboat Itchy.
" [ Whistling .]
- [ Whistle Sounds .]
- [ Horn Tooting .]
[ Whistling .]
[ Screaming .]
- [ Screaming .]
- [ Chuckling .]
Oh, me, oh, my.
- ## [ Fanfare .]
- [ Laughing .]
During the war, Itchy and Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
[ Patriotic .]
We'll be back with a real-life Itchy and Scratchy-- a rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
[ Chuckling .]
Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie? Sounds like something you'd say.
Hey, where is she? Oh, my Lord! Oh, isn't that cute.
A baby driving a car.
And look.
There's a dog driving a bus.
Hey! [Alarm Sounding.]
All right! Time for a crime spree.
All right, boy.
This calls for the biggest punishment I ever handed down and this time it's gonna stick.
- Come on, Homer.
This isn't funny.
- Damn right! Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy and Scratchy movie ever! [ Gasps .]
[ Groans .]
Oh, no! Beta! Dad, you gotta let me see that movie.
Can't you just give me a spanking? Come on.
Go nuts.
Don't point that thing at me.
I said you're not going to the movie, and I'm sticking to it.
Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished but The Itchy and Scratchy Movie is the defining event of our generation.
How would you've liked it if someone told you That you couldn't watch the moon landing? Hmm.
That's one small step for man.
One giant leap for mankind.
[ Sniffles .]
[ Singing Pop .]
[ Singing Continues .]
Sorry, but the punishment stands.
I regret nothing! [ Groans .]
- Someday you'll thank me for this, son.
- Not bloody likely.
No, it's true.
You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt, but my dad wouldn't get it for me.
So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table.
The doctor thought I might have brain damage.
- Dad, what's the point of this story? - I like stories.
Can I please go to the movie? I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it.
- You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV.
- TV sucks.
I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that! [ Man On TV.]
The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour.
I'm not licked yet.
I can entertain myself.
No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy.
[ Groans .]
- How was it? - It wasn't that great.
- Be honest.
- It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life! And you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos-- Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson-- Of course, they didn't use their real names, But you could tell it was them.
- Lisa! - Sorry, Bart.
It's just not the same.
I've seen The Itchy and Scratchy Movie I've seen it 17 times.
You guys must be getting pretty tired of that movie by now.
- No one who saw the movie would say that! - Let's get him! [ Screams .]
Homer, we'd like to talk to you.
But then I won't be watching TV.
You can see the bind I'm in.
Dad, you've gotta let Bart see that movie.
I've never seen him like this.
He has the demented melancholia Of a Tennessee Williams heroine.
- Don't you think I know that? - Well, it's been two months.
You laid down the law, and I'm proud of you.
- But I think we've gotten through to him.
- Ah, sweet, softhearted Marge.
You just can't see the big picture.
If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up chief justice of the Supreme Court.
If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a Mr.
Tight Buns competition.
I can't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
And I can't let that happen.
One for Itchy and Scratchy.
- We promised your dad we wouldn't.
- [ Groans .]
I'm here at the Springfield Aztec Theater where, after eight months and nine Academy Awards The Itchy and Scratchy Movie is showing for the last time.
Tomorrow, a new movie starring Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke will open.
Will it be as successful? Only time will tell.
Well, Dad, I guess you won.
No, son.
We both won.
You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special.
Well, I'll be.
The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.
Come on.
What do you say? All right.
I think you've learned your lesson.
One senior citizen and one chief justice Of the Supreme Court.
Eh, eh, eh.
I'll get it, son.
- That'll be $650.
- D'oh.
One Soylent Green, hold the butter.
Mmm.
Soylent Green.
[ Theme .]

Get out! Yea! - [ Horn Sounds .]

Now, over the next six hours, I'll be taking you through the do's and do-not-do's of foundation repair.
- Ready? - Ready! First, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel.
Hand me my patching trowel, boy.
- Hmm.
- Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation? - No.
- Good.
Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws.
- Install.
- What do I do in case-- After applying brushable coating to the panels-- - Wait a minute.
- you'll need corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath.
- Wait a minute! - If you can't find metal stucco lath-- - Uh-huh? - use carbon-fiber stucco lath.
- Ohh! - Now parge the lath.
[Glass Shatters.]
- Did you see the bubble? - Yeah, I'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking.
Uh, I figure it's gonna Cost you, oh, 8,500.

- Hey! Then I could follow my dream-- living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
[ Thinking .]
March 1 5th.
I wish I brought a TV.
Oh, God, how I miss TV.
[ Chittering .]
- I think you have to keep your job too.
- Aw! It was the most beautiful, most expensive train ever built-- the Spruce Caboose.
Some people said it was too big to stay on the tracks.
[ Chuckles .]
They were right.
- We're here for the retirement party.
- Follow the Headless Brakeman.

Please don't make me retire.

Yaah! With the departure of Mr.

- Now, get out.
The bar is closed.
- [ All Groaning .]
Maybe I should apply for that job.
Forget it, Marge.
We already live together.
We shouldn't work together.
As the Bible says "Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's racket.
" Where does the Bible say "racket"? It's in there.
Look, Marge, We just don't need the money that bad.
[ Yelling .]
Well, Lisa, I finished my rÃ©sumÃ©.

When I'm done.

This rÃ©sumÃ© is very impressive.
Let me be the first to say-- [ Speaking Foreign Language .]

Sorry, the position has been filled.

- Oh, dear.
Marge, you're making a big mistake.
- I'm gonna see you all day at work and all night at home-- - [ Groans .]
And that's good! But here's the bad part.
Uh-- Uh-- Ooh! Look at that headline! "Canada To Hold Referendum.
" Sorry, Marge.
Can't talk now.
We need the money, and my life is pretty boring.
Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave.
They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.
- Yeah, lemonade is good.
- I think it's wonderful.
Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant.
- You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
- What did they do? They discovered radium.
Then they both died of radiation poisoning.

It's the Curies! We must flee! [ Shouting, Growling .]
Cool.
Now, Marge, just remember-- If something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English.
Ah, Tibor, how many times Have you saved my butt? [ Chuckles .]
Maggie, Your baby sitter's here.
What's that mean? Oh, you must be sick.
Let's see.
What's old Doc Washburn prescribe? Do you have dropsy? The grippe? Scrofula? The vapors? Jungle rot? Dandy fever? Poor man's gout? Housemaid's knee? Climatic poopow? The staggers? Dum-dum fever? And this is your office.
That idiot Tibor lost the key but you canjimmy it open with a credit card.

- Well, have fun.
- What do I do? - [ Chuckles .]
Marge, please.
According to your rÃ©sumÃ©, you invented this machine.
[All Yelling.]
Put away your books, children.
It's time for your English test.

Marge, what are you doing? It's lunchtime.
I'll just be a minute.
I have to finish this paperwork.
Marge, Marge, Marge let's file this under "R" for arrivederci.
- Where does it go? - Don't worry, baby.
The tube'll know what to do.
Good news, boy.
I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasn't exactly a pharmacy.

- Hello! - Mr.

I just came to give you the orchids and fragrant bath oils I lavish upon all my employees.
- Oh, aren't you nice.
- [ Chuckles .]
Gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low.
[ Sobbing .]
I am the angel of death.
The time of purification is at hand.
Oh, who cares.
Marge, what can we do? Well, you could give them healthier snacks, theme days-- You mean like Child Labor Day? Mmm.
Actually, I was thinking of Funny Hat Day.
- Oh.
- Ooh! And how about piping in some Tom Jones music? That always cheers me up.
[Man Singing Pop.]
It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.
You can't take our doughnuts! Yaah! Right.
Anyone else want to be a hero? Ooh.
Marge, I'm giving you a raise and a new office right next to mine.
[ Chuckling .]
But, sir, that's my office.
Don't worry, Smithers.
I'm putting you where the action is.
Springtime fresh, Winter white.
- What could be better? - Oh, man, I really gotta-- No-o-o! So, Bart, how are you feeling? - Can't complain.
- Well, then, you're ready for your makeup test.
[ Groaning .]
My ovaries! [ Chuckles .]
Suckers.
Have you ever read "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"'? I glanced at it.
Boy cries "wolf," has a few laughs.
I forget how it ends.
[ Sputtering .]
Bart, is that light green? - Yeah.
- It better be! - Hey! - [ Groans .]
- Homie, what's wrong? - I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me-- friends, coworkers, Tibor.
I never thought it'd be my own wife.
Well, maybe you'd get promoted If you worked a little harder.
Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese beaver.
Oh, really? I came to See you three times today.
Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy.
I'm gonna go right downstairs, unfold the couch, unroll the sleeping ba-- Eh, good night.
[ Snoring .]
[Sighs.]
I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers.
You know that dream where you're in bed, and they fly in through the window? [ Moaning .]
You've been reading My wish book, sir.
Yes, well, Smithers, I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate-- Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson? Uh, do you remember we did that once before? Oh, that's right.
He's dead.
And rather pungent.
The rest of that night is something I'd like to forget.
All right, then.
Bring me that crooner she likes so much, Tom Jones.
These spurs are killing me.
Ey-y-y.
Sit on it.
Lenny, '50s day is next Wednesday.
I gotta go home and change! [Motorcycle Revving.]
- Here's your money.
- You know the problem here was water leakage.
If you just buy a fifty-cent washer-- I've got a better idea.
Get the hell out! Look, I've got some washers in my truck.
I'll give you one.
Marge, get my gun.
[Fanfare.]
[Women Screaming.]
- Tom Jones? - Yes? I was wondering if you'd be interested in performing at a private party.
Sorry, mate.
I don't do private parties.
Well, then, perhaps you should look in this suitcase.
All right, but I don't see-- [ Gagging, Coughing .]
Pleasant dreams, Mr.
Jones.
Bart, to avoid this test, you've had smallpox, the bends and that unfortunate bout of rabies.
Well, I'm not sure I'm over it.

You're wasting valuable test time.
Mr.

Dinner, dancing, and Mr.
Tom Jones.
- Hello, Marge.
- That's it.
Big smile.
Everybody's happy.
- Oh, my goodness! - [ Groans .]
My husband will be so excited! You have a husband? Yes.
I can picture him now-- rugged good looks, sweater knotted about his shoulders curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold! Homer, Mr.
Burns gave me another raise today.
[ Laughing .]
The senile old fool.
- You're fired! - You can't fire me just because I'm married.
I'm going to sue the pants off you.
You don't have to sue me to get my pants off.

Hey, wolfie, putdown that hors d'oeuvre.
It's time for the main course! [ Yelling .]
Back to class, lad.
Nothin' to see here.
[ Shouting .]
Here's my test.
I'm not even going to grade this until you tell me the truth about what happened out there.
The truth is-- There was no wolf.
I faked the whole thing.
I'm just gonna lie on the floor now.
- Please don't let me swallow my tongue.
- [Body Thuds.]
There.
Doesn't it feel better to tell the truth? Oh, dear.
All right, now, boy.
We've got to rub some garlic on you before the next full moon.
- [ Panting .]
- Don't feel bad for losin'.
I was wrestling wolves back when you were at your mother's teat.
Why, Marge, look at all those flies buzzing around your head.
You're a mess, woman.

So, do you think I have a case? Mrs.
Simpson, you're in luck.
Your sexual harassment suit is just the thing I need to rebuild my shattered practice.
Care to join me in a belt of scotch? It's 9:30 in the morning.
Yeah, but I haven't slept in days.

Oh, yeah.
Mr.

Yes, well, I have [ Gasping, Yells .]
He left his briefcase.
Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.
Well, I guess that's it.
People like us can't afford justice.
- Come on, Homie.
Let's go before he fires you too.
- No! Mr.
Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife.
- You love her too.
- Damn right! Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life.
Gotcha.
Marge, we're gettin' some drive-through; then we're doing it twice.
No, no, no.
I've got something even more special in mind.
[ Singing .]
- Mwah! - Ooh! Get help, luv.
Call Interpol, get me a hacksaw, anything.

[Theme.]
Okay, Ron, which one of our girls said the following about you-- "He looked so sexy, I hoped we would have sex"? Well, that's a tough one, 'cause I did the deed with Uta, Candy and Shasta.
- [ All Giggling .]
- It's true, all right! [ Chuckles .]
But I'm gonna have to go with Shasta 'cause she liked makin' bacon on the beach.
Ooh.
Me too.
- Ahhh, bacon.
- [Knocking On Door.]
Mr.
Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move.
Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh? Yes.
Well, there's a few things you could do to help us sell our home.
First, whenever you walk in front of your window - could you please wear pants? - Mmm, no.
Second, could you please take in your jack-o'-lanterns - from past Halloweens? - [ Buzzing .]
- Mmm, no.
- And please cover your garbage.
It's attracting wildlife.
Wha-- Hey, moose! Shoo! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! Get off my lawn, now! [ Yells .]
Hello.
What's this? Wire hangers.
Expired medicine.
Old newspapers! [ Panting .]
Okay, Homer, stay calm.
just quietly get this stuff inside your house.
Homer, you're not listening! - That medicine's not for you.
- Come on, Marge.
Maybe I'm not getting enough estrogen.
- Give me that.
- [Man On TV.]
Ahoy, mateys.
Had your fill of tacos? Would ye sooner eat a bilge rat than another burger? Then come for all-you-can-eat seafood at The Frying Dutchman.
[ Drooling Loudly.]
- Is it more iced tea ye be needing? - Okay.
[ Laughing Heartily.]
Set sail for The Frying Dutchman.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Marge, we're going to that restaurant.
But I think I'm allergic to seafood.
The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up, and I went into convulsions.
Mmm, shrimp.
Now, I don't know much about haggling or bargaining so why don't we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want? - That could work.
- [Homer Belches.]
- What was that? - Sigh.
Hmm? There you are! Thought you could get away, huh? - Good-bye.
- [ Groans .]
I don't think we should be down here.
Nervous, Lise? I don't blame you.
This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son.
Bart, the Winfields didn't have a son.
See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
[ Eerie Voice .]
Hello, Lisa.
Here in the dark, you won't need those eyes.
- Let me have them.
- Bart, that's not funny! There are some who say the monster - is still here! - [ Screaming .]
[ Laughing .]
[ Erie Voice .]
Friend.
Friend! [ Screaming .]
[Girl.]
Hey, kid, wake up.
- [Bart.]
Who are you? - I'm Laura, your new neighbor.
You all right? [ Thinking .]
She's beautiful.
Say something clever.
I fell on my bottom.
[ Thinking .]
D'oh! Oh, not again! My mother's inside, Mrs.
Simpson.
Please go right on in.
Oh, you speak so politely to adults.
My upbringing was painfully strict, ma'am.
That's sweet.
[Marge.]
And, finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying "Welcome to Springfield.
'" Thank you.
This is all so nice.
I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield especially after that Time cover story, "America's Worst City.
" - You could see our house in that photo.
- Oh.
And this is, uh, for the man of the house which I guess is you.
[ Nervous Groan .]
I guess I should explain.
Laura's father and I divorced two years ago.
[ Chuckles .]
They're so sweet when you marry them.
- But soon, it's just career, career, career.
- [Homer.]
My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way! [ Groans .]
I bet you don't know this one.
How'd you like a Hertz donut? - [ Groans .]
- Hurts, don't it? [ Chuckles .]
Right.
Do you know what a wet willie is? - Is it this? - [Kearney.]
Hey, baby! How about puttin' your finger in my ear? Well, I don't know.
Your boyfriend looks like the jealous type.
- Hey, what the-- - That chick's messin' with our minds.
- Let's get out of here.
- Now, where were we? - Oh, yeah.
I was gonna tell your fortune.
- Huh? - Oh, man.
You're gonna be rich! - Whoa! There's your mansion.
There's the tennis court.
[ Spits .]
And there's the swimming pool.
See you later, Bart.
[ Chuckles .]
I'll never wash this hand again.
[Lisa.]
Dad, make Bart wash his hand.
Sorry, Lise.
I no longer control the hand.
- The hand controls me! - Dad! Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to babysit my little angels.
Sorry, this isn't Abbie.
This is her sister.
I look after her now.
No, Bart, put it down.
Put it down, Bart.
Bart, put it down.
Oh! No all-you-can-eat seafood.
I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing.
- Nothing! - Maybe Laura could watch us.
Oh, I get it.
"Bart, the babysitter's here.
" "Let me tuck you in.
" - Silence! - [ Yells .]
Huh? [ Yelling .]
Maybe it's time I wash my hand.
I'll send Laura over to babysit as soon as she gets home.
Great.
Oh, uh, and there was something else.
- Something I was supposed to tiptoe around-- - My divorce.
That's it! Whoo-hoo! I'm glad one of us remembered.
That could have been embarrassing.
Well, I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes.
I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it.
- After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites.
- [ Chuckles .]
I know what you mean.
just let me make sure we're not talking about food.
- I'm not.
- Right.
Me neither.
- We're talking about sex, right? - Right.
I hear you loud and clear.
[ Purrs .]
- Bart, are you taking a bath? - Yes, I am.
And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
This wouldn't have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it? Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest.
Why, Laura.
What a pleasant surprise.
Cute.
What do you guys want for dinner? I don't care.
Ask Hef over there.
Lady's choice.
Sometimes I think you want to fail! Shut up.
just shut up! - [ Ringing .]
- [ Both Grunting .]
We used to eat this when my dad was stationed in "Vandihar.
" Take your kaftab'Sounieh and dip it in the labneh.
Now, that is good labneh.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything on the menu has fish in it.
What about the bread? Does that have much fish in it? - Yes.
- Well, I have some Tic Tacs in my purse-- Excellent choice.
And for the gentleman? - All you can eat! All you can eat! - All right.
When you're ready, take this plate over-- Please, don't take the steam tray! Sir! Come on, Bart.
If I can teach Maggie to waltz, I can teach you.
[Waltz.]
just follow me.
Put your hand on my hip.
[ Voice Cracking .]
Okay.
- Wedgie! - Whoa! [Homer Eating Loudly.]
[ Snoring .]
That man ate all our shrimp and two plastic lobsters! 'Tis no man.
'Tis a remorseless eating machine.
Arr! - Six bells.
Time for closin'.
- Can't talk.
Eating.
Fairly warned be thee, says I.
Huh? Hey! Hey! Hey! But the sign said, "All you can eat.
" [ Groaning .]
I'm gonna fight this thing.
Oh, please don't.
For me? Sorry, Marge.
This is my quest.
I'm like that guy, that Spanish guy.
- You know, he fought the windmills.
- Don Quixote? No, that's not it.
What's his name? "The Man of La Mancha.
" - Don Quixote.
- No! I really think that was the character's name-- Don Quixote.
Fine.
I'll look it up.
Well, who was it? - Never mind.
- Mm-hmm.
[ Alarm Ringing .]
Oh, no! Here comes the conservative judge! [Growling.]
Plead insanity! Plead insanity! - It's not working! - All right.
Hit the "change of venue" button.
Now! [Bart.]
Oh, no.
You're in Texas! - [ Yelling .]
- Yee-haw! If I'd hit the "remorse" button one more time, I would have made it.
Ah, Bart, I gotta go.
See you around.
- I am thinking you like this girl, yes? - How did you know? My ceiling mirrors and video cameras sometimes see more than who is about to shoot me.
"All you can eat.
'" Ha! Mr.
Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film The Neverending Story.
So, do you think I have a case? Homer, I don't use the word "hero" very often.
But you are the greatest hero in American history.
Whoo-hoo! - I'm here to see my Grampa.
- Here I am, sonny.
- You're not my grandpa.
- Ah, come on.
Give me a chance.
Hey, can your grandfather do this? [ Karate Yells .]
- Oh! - Bart! Aw, you remembered my birthday.
Huh? Oh.
I sure did.
- Here's a bus schedule.
- Wow! Fits right in my pocket.
Grampa, I need some advice.
Did you ever have a crush on an older woman? I had a crush on the oldest woman.
- Here's a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake.
- What happened? She fell in with that Guinness Book of Records crowd.
Suddenly, she didn't have any time for me.
Oh! I wore a 1 5-pound beard of bees for that woman, but it just wasn't enough.
Dad, I have some questions about women.
Uh, can't you see I'm readin' the, uh, cultural calendar? Ooh! "Mostly Mozart" is in town.
Homer, Bart's at a very curious age.
As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about you know.
But, Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did.
Are you sure? [ Thinking .]
Hmm.
- [Monkeys Chittering.]
- Zookeeper! Zookeeper! Those two monkeys are killing each other! - [ Whispering .]
They're having sex.
- Oh? Maybe you're right.
Now, if you'll excuse us this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.
Son, a woman is a lot like, um a refrigerator.
They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds.
They make ice and-- Oh, wait a minute.
Actually, a woman is more like a beer.
They smell good.
They look good.
You'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one.
You wanna drink another woman.
So I says, "Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it "'cause I don't know where it is, you bologna.
You make me wanna retch.
" [ Snoring .]
[ Sighs .]
How can I get her to notice me? Meet me at the tree house, Bart.
And come alone.
[ Gulps .]
- Thanks for coming.
- I please to aim.
I'm so happy.
I just had to tell someone.
I have a boyfriend.
You won't be needing this.
[ Groans .]
A boyfriend? I really think you'd like him, Bart.
His name's Jimbo.
Jimbo Jones? - [ Grunting .]
- [Knocking.]
Uh, you've been flushing for 20 minutes.
- Is there a problem? - [Jimbo.]
Uh, no, Principal Skinner.
- [Chuckling.]
- Very well.
I'll continue to wait.
- ## [ Humming .]
- [Toilet Flushing.]
- ## [ Whistling .]
- [Flushing Continues.]
How can you like that guy? I don't know.
Maybe 'cause he's an outlaw.
- You know that dead body they found behind the mayor's house? -Jimbo killed him? - No, but he poked him with a stick.
- [Moped Engine Running.]
Hey, Laura, Dr.
Tongue has arrived.
That's him, Bart! - Who's the dork? - Leave him alone.
He's just a kid.
[Echoing.]
Just a kid.
Just a kid.
I'll show them who's just a kid.
[Marge.]
Bart, it's your bedtime.
- I laid out your jammy-jams.
- [ Groans .]
[Eating Loudly.]
Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do? - I married her! [ Laughing .]
- [ Snickering .]
Homer, please.
[ Hiccups .]
I just had eggs.
Good luck in your trumped-up lawsuit, Dad.
Thanks.
That means a lot to me.
All right, you guys.
I want you in bed before Jimbo gets here.
What do you like about him? He's just a good-lookin' rebel who plays by his own rules.
[ Both Sigh .]
'Twas a moonless night, dark as pitch when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man.
- Hey! - So I says to me bosuns, "Batten down the mizzenmast.
" Captain McCallister, isn't it a fact that you're not a real captain? - Aye.
- [ All Gasping .]
Your Honor, I would like to show the court just how much shrimp Mr.
Simpson ate.
Bring it in, boys! all addressed to "Santa Claus.
" You want "The People of Springfield versus Kris Kringle.
" - That's next door.
- Oh.
Mrs.
Simpson, isn't it true your husband once consumed a 1 0-pound bag of flour when no other food was available? - Yes, but it was-- - Your witness.
- Uh, there's a pizza here for-- - Right here.
Mrs.
Simpson, what did you and your husband do after you were ejected from the restaurant? We pretty much went straight home.
Mrs.
Simpson, you're under oath.
We drove around until 3:00 a.
m.
looking for another all-you-can-eat fish restaurant.
- [Spectators Murmuring.]
- And when you couldn't find one? - We went fishing.
[ Sobbing .]
- [Spectators Gasping.]
Do these sound like the actions of a man who had "all he could eat"? - No! - That could've been me! Homer, I've a proposition forye, fair and true.
Come on, Marge.
Let the people see your pretty face.
Come see "Bottomless Pete," nature's cruelest mistake.
Come for the freak, stay for the food.
- Oh, he's hideous! - I heard they shaved a gorilla.
Hey, baby, my shirt's chafin' me.
- Mind if I take it off? - Well, okay.
I gotta do something! Hmm.
But it says, "Good for one free beer at Moe's.
" This is Moe's Tavern, isn't it? No, this is Bo's Cavern.
Give me my beer.
Stupid Welcome Mobile.
I knew it would ruin me! - [ Ringing .]
- Yeah, just a sec.
I'll check.
Uh, Amanda Huggenkiss! Hey, I'm looking for Amanda Huggenkiss! Why can't I find Amanda Huggenkiss? [ All Laughing .]
Maybe your standards are too high.
You little S.
O.
B! If I ever find out who you are, I'm gonna shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving dogs in your butt! My name is Jimbo Jones, and I live at 1 094 Evergreen Terrace.
Aha! Big mistake, pal! Ho-ho! I knew he'd slip up sooner or later.
Ah, yes.
Rusty and dull.
Barney, don't steal any beer while I'm gone.
What kind of pathetic drunk Do you take me for? [ Gasps .]
Somebody spilled beer in this ashtray.
[ Slurps Loudly.]
Ahh.
[ Grunting, Laughing Sinisterly.]
Let's see.
Where is that map? Evergreen Terrace.
There it is-- F-5.
[Laughing Continues.]
I don't believe it.
Now my pants are chafin' me.
[ Panting .]
All right, who's Jimbo Jones? - I am.
- You just made your second mistake, buddy boy! Please, dude, don't hurt me.
Oh, man.
[ Sobbing .]
- That's your outlaw? - I wasn't really gonna kill ya.
I was just gonna cut ya.
[ Sobbing Continues .]
Ah, forget it.
Ouch! I better go check on Barney.
Uh-oh.
My heart just stopped.
Ah, there it goes.
[ Grunting, Laughing Sinisterly.]
- [Thump.]
- Ow! Stupid wishing well! Jimbo, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're just not the guy I thought you were.
[ Sniffles .]
Can I have my shirt back? [ Blowing Nose .]
Well, Bart, you were right about him.
As usual, a knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
You know, if you were only old enough to grow a bad teenage mustache - I'd go out with you in a second.
- Wow.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Miss Tinkle, first name - [ Whispering .]

D'oh! Now, before I give you the check, one more question.
Uh, this place, Moe's, you left just before the accident this is a business of some kind? [ Thinking .]
Don't tell him you were at a bar.

But what else is open at night? It's a pornography store.
I was buying pornography.

Mr.

[ Screaming .]
Ah, I can't afford it.
Pally, this doesn't cost money.
It makes money.
You make the payments by plowing driveways on the side.
Well, I really should discuss this with my wife.
Your wife? [ Imitates Whipcrack.]
What, you think I'm gonna buy a $20,000 truck just because you make that noise? [ Imitates Whipcracks .]
I'll take it! I'll take it! I can't believe you bought that plow.
We can't afford it.
If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things.

Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom you know the number to call when you need a plow is Klondike 5-3226.

Not as low as my low, low prices.

Yea! Hello, I'm Mr.

He could still surprise ya.
But I'm a real tightwad.
Can I afford this remarkable system? Absolutely.

[Moe.]
Here you go, Mr.

- A beer on the house.
- Wow, Moe! You didn't even give a beer to those freed Iranian hostages.
Ah, they shouldn't have been there in the first place.
But Homer is a real hero.
I wish I was a hero.
Well, wishing won't make it so.
You gotta pull up your diaper, get out there and be the best damn Barney you can be.
Here I come, world! [ Yelling .]

I've got two words for you.
Mellow out, man.
- Hmm? Hmm? - All right.
Just one-- if it'll get you off my back.
Hey! Where have you been all my life? [ Sighs .]
Thank you, Plow Kingaly-ding.
[ Chuckles .]
Flanders, I thought I was your plowman.
Uh, Homer, why don't you plow it again? Forget it, pal.
I don't need your phony-baloney job.
I'll take your money, but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
Mr.
West, you said there was a job for me.
There was.
When I called you-- So long, Superman.
Your secret identity is safe with me.
[ Sputters .]
[Homer.]
Ring, damn you.
Ring.
- [ Rings .]
- Mr.
Plow.
That name again is Mr.
Plow.
[ Man .]
Hello, I'm calling from Delinquent Accounts at Kumatsu Motors.
Oh, you want the Mr.
Plow who plows driveways.
This is Tony Plow.
You know, from Leave It to Beaver.
Yeah.
They were gay.
- Oh, what am I gonna do? - I think you should do a new ad one that's fresh and original.
I know.
I'll do a rap.
[ Imitating Beat Box .]

[ Lisa Groans .]
[ Bart Groaning .]
- Please.
- ## [ Ends .]
- Stop it right now.
- Promise you'll never do that again.
All right.
Mr.
Simpson, I guarantee you we'll come up with a commercial that can save your business.
You know those radio ads where two people with annoying voices yammer back and forth? I invented those.
Ow! Happens all the time.
[ Singing Aria .]
Dad, was that your commercial? I don't know.
The torch has been passed to a new generation of, uh snowplow people.
Come on.
Give me the key.
- These look like teeth marks.
- I thought there was chocolate inside.
- Well, why was it wrapped in foil? - It was never wrapped in foil.
Hardest hit by the blizzard is Springfield's forbidding Widow's Peak.
Our own Arnie Pie is on the scene.
Everything's snowed in.
All I can see is white.
Arnie, please.
The ski conditions.
Mayday, Mayday.
I think I'm flying into a mountain.
Tell my wife I love-- [ Chuckles .]
That's great, Arnie.
Hmm.
[ Disguises Voice .]
Hello.
Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak.
I don't know.
I'd be up there all day.
I wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways.
There's a $1 0,000 bill in it for you.
Oh, yeah? Which president's on it? Uh, all of them.
They're having a party.
jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.
Wow! I'll be right there.
Barney, I'd like to put a Spanish version Of your jingle on my next album.
[ Singing In Spanish .]
Yeah, you do that.
Well, I guess you can plow my driveway.
But I wonder what happened to the Plow King.
Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers.
Oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt.
[ Softly.]
Kiss my asphalt.
So I says, "Kiss my asphalt.
" Hmm? Hmm? Springfield's beloved Plow King is trapped.
- [ All Gasp .]
- Barney Gumble, shown here donating $50,000 to the Shelbyville Dance Theater was caught in a sudden avalanche on Widow's Peak earlier today.
It was captured on film by a camera crew making the upcoming Fox special In Search of Bigfoot.
[ Man .]
Hold it, Bob.
We can see your wristwatch.
- Oh, damn it.
- Hey, what's that? - [ Burps .]
- [Rumbling.]
Aaah! This is all my fault.
I've gotta save him.
Homie, please, don't go.
Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat.

[ Inhales Deeply, Sighs .]
Ah, dying's not so bad.
I'll be reunited with my loved ones-- my dad and that plant I never watered.
[Rumbling.]
Barney! Homer, you saved my life, and I'm not gonna forget it.
From now on, we'll be partners.
Barney, that's great.
When two best friends work together not even God himself can stop them.
[Booming Male Voice.]
Oh, no? The snow's melted.
We can go outside again.
I don't like the looks Of those teenagers.
Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded greenhouse effect? Well, if70Â° days in the middle of winter are the price of car pollution you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac.
[ Chuckles .]
- [ Rings .]
- Y'ello.
[ Man .]
Hello.
This is the Repo Depot.
I'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow.
Oh, yeah? How dumb do you think I-- - Oh.
- Oh, now, Homie, you have your health you have your best friend back and you do have that certain special something.
- You mean-- - Mm-hmm.

- Kitty.

- [ Belches .]
- Did you hear that? She said "burlap".
I don't think so.
Oh, Maggie, when are you going to talk? Well, don't push her.
Remember 'Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
" [ Thinking .]
What does that mean? You better say something, or they'll think you're stupid.
Takes one to know one! Swish! According to Fretful Mother Magazine if Maggie doesn't talk by age one we should consider a corrective tongue extender.
- Hey, what was my first word? - Uh, well-- [Marge Snickering.]
Whoa! - [Homer Chuckling.]
Yes.
- Oh.
Â¡Aye carumba! You know, I don't think I remember.
But the story of Lisa's first word is very cute.
- [ Lisa, Bart .]
Tell it, Mom.
- Yeah, tell it, Mom.
Well, this story begins in that unforgettable spring of 1 983.
Ms.
Pac-Man struck a blow for women's rights.
A young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh.
Before Lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East Side of Springfield.

Then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.
- Then what happened? - Uh-- They had 30 sons and 30 daughters.
- What were their names? - [ Groans .]
Dennis, Brianna Mavis, Brad-- [ Snoring .]
No, this is true.
The Coast Guard arrested Boy George for scraping the barnacles off his dinghy.

- Hi-yo! - [ Laughs .]
Hi-yo! [ Chuckles .]
Got your nose.
Got your wallet.
- [ Flushing .]
- No! Bart, don't you ever do that again.
Understand? - Beep.
- [ Growls .]
Guess what, Homie? There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.
- We're gonna start doin' it in the morning? - No! - Oh.
- We're going to have another baby.
Marge, that's-- - Bye-bye, keys.
- [ Flushing .]
[ Yelling .]
Hear that, Bart? You're going to have a little brother or sister to play with.
- [ Gasps .]
Who did this? - Baby.
- Bad baby.
- [ Chuckles .]
[ Gasps .]
Uh-oh.
I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
No, we won't.
I've got it all figured out.
The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21 .
- Won't that warp him? - My Cousin Frank did it.
You don't have a Cousin Frank.
He became Francine back in '76.
Then he joined that cult.
I think his name is Mother Shabubu now.
[ Groaning .]
That afternoon, we left Bart with my sisters and went house-hunting.
Hey, Bart, want a dollar? Ah, ah, ah.
You know what I wanna hear.
[ Singing Children's Songs .]

Now, Mr.

This one just came on the market.
- Oh, dear! - [ Forced Chuckle .]
Now, here we have beautiful Hardwood floors, track lighting-- [ Sniffing .]
What's that stench? Once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat you'll wonder how you ever did without it.
- Mmm.
Hog fat.
- Let's keep looking.
[ Sniffs .]
Ooh.
Do you smell something? Arr! Why buy a house when ye can buy a houseboat? Excuse me.
[ Yells .]
Don't forget to check out the galley.
That's real shag carpeting.
Arr! [Cats Meowing.]
Once we get the cats out, it won't be too bad.
Actually, according to the will, the cats own the house.
You'd be their tenants.
- [ Screeching .]
- [ Gasps .]
I wish we lived in the kitty house.
I could've trained them to be my unholy army of the night.
Go, my pretties.
Kill! Kill! We were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect.
Just imagine what we can do with this place.
Wow.
How much? How much? Well, here's what they're asking.
Oh, I can't afford that! - Dad, I have a problem.
- Why'd you come to me? I don't know nothin'.
I used to get by on my looks.
Now they're gone, withered away like an old piece of fruit.
[ Sobbing .]
- Are you done? - No, not yet.
I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York.
Dad, I don't need advice.
I need $1 5,000 to buy a home.
Oh! Well, all I own is this house that I built with my own two hands.
You didn't build this house.
You won it on a crooked '50s game show.
I ratted on everybody and got off scot-free.
Ha-ha! All right, son.
I'll sell this dump and write you a check.
Dad, first you gave me life.
Now you've given me a home for my family.
I'd be honored If you came to live with us.
Thank you.
So how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks' home? - About three weeks.
- [ All Laughing .]
Maggie, I'll give you this cookie If you talk.
What? What? D'oh! All right, you win round seven.
When are we gonna get to my first word? - Your what what? - My first word! Eh, you don't wanna hear that story.
I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr.
Mooney.
- It was another one of my harebrained schemes.
- Dad! Wait a minute.
That was The Lucy Show.
Okay, where were we? Mom was preggers, and Dad just threw all our money down the sinkhole.
Ah, yes.
I remember the day we moved in.
[ Straining .]
Hey, Homer, this house sucks.
Bart, I told you not to use that word.
Call me "Daddy".
- Homer.

- Who the hell are you? My name's Todd.
Would you be my friend? You're funny.
[ Chuckles .]
- If you need anything, just give a whistle.
- I could use a TV tray.
- Well, gee, I-- - What? I just this minute bought it at the hardware-- - You said anything.

Well, sure, you can borrow it for a little while.
And that "little while" is now eight years and counting.
[ Chuckles .]
Anyway, Bart had just entered the terrible twos.

Hello? Honey? Honey, honey, honey? Could you please be quiet? [ Singing Loudly.]

What an age we live in! Now, what you see here is the radioactive dye we injected flowing through your husband's circulatory system.
But, Doctor, I haven't injected the dye yet! - Good Lord.

Now, Homer, this is a new body fat analysis test.
I start you jiggling and measure how long it takes to stop.
Whoo-hoo! Look at that blubber fly! Yes.
Nurse, cancel my 1 :00.
Homer, I'm afraid you'll have to undergo a coronary bypass operation.
- Say it in English, Doc.
- You're going to need open-heart surgery.
Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
We're going to cut you open and tinker with your ticker.
- Could you dumb it down a shade? - Doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my Homie well.
Good.
I must warn you though.
This procedure will cost you upwards of $30,000.

- [Thud.]

I'm afraid it's now 40,000.
Okay, Okay.

Have we deposited any $40,000 checks that haven't cleared yet? No.
Don't you have health insurance at work? Well, actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge.

Questions? Questions? Oh! My whole scheme down the-- I mean, ask away.
Oh, good.
Now, under "heart attacks," you crossed out "3" and wrote "0.
" Oh, I thought that said "brain hemorrhages.
" Uh-huh.
And, uh, do you drink? I do enjoy a snifter of port at Christmas.
All right.
Here's your policy.
Now let me tell you something, Mr.
Sucker.
I just-- Oh, hold on there.
Uh, you still have to sign it.
Oh.
I-- [ Gasps .]
Must sign policy! Sir, I'm sorry.
We can't insure you.
- I made an "H.
" - No, that doesn't count.
It's like an "X.
" [ Groans .]
Hey, we'd better get you to a hospital.
- Can I have a free calendar? - Okay.
- Clear! - [ Groaning .]
Oh, Doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone.
And there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt.
Mr.
Simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible.
I can't afford it.
Maybe I should buy one of those machines.
[ Groaning .]
Oh, yeah.
That's the stuff.
Now, I know I haven't been the best Christian.
In fact, when you're up there "blah, blah, blah-ing," I'm usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners.
Well, anyhoo, can I have $40,000? Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew but I rented Fiddler on the Roof, and I will watch it.
- Anyway, can I have $40,000? - Hmm? Now, I know I haven't been the best-- Oh, forget it.
- Honey, did you have any luck? - No, but the rabbi gave me this.
- What is it, Dad? - Son, they call it a "droodle.
" Whoo-hoo! Look at it go! Hi, everybody! Are you looking for a way to slash the cost of your medical expenses? - Boring! - Wait! This might be the answer we're looking for.
I will perform any operation for 1 29.
95.
Come in for brain surgery and receive a free Chinese finger trap.
[ Grunting .]
Okay, friend.
You tried the best.
Now try the rest.
Call 1 -600-DOCTORB.
The "B" is for "bargain"! Well, Marge, we could do worse.
- How? - Uh, some dog could do the operation.
Operation? What are you talking about? Kids, I have something to tell you.
Oh, Homie, I don't know.
This might upset them.
Nothing you say can upset us.
We're the MTV generation.
- We feel neither highs nor lows.
- Really? What's it like? - Eh.
- Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.
So the tiny Aorta fairies will take Mr.
Leg Vein on a long trip to get married to Princess Left Ventricle.
Dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary artery bypass graft? - Uh, yeah.
- Oh, no.
What if they botch it? I won't have a dad for a while.
[ Sobbing .]
Kids.
Kids.
I'm not gonna die.
- That only happens to bad people.

What are you in for? - I got a bad heart.

Shut up, Flanders.
Hi, everybody! I'm Dr.

Please report to the coroner immediately.

I think I'll go out the window.
- Ho! - [Objects Clattering.]
Dear Lord, thank you For Ziggy comics, little baby ducks and Sweatin' to the Oldies, volumes one, two and four.
Dear Lord, I'm really scared about this operation tomorrow.
If something happens, please look after Marge - and make sure my kids grow up right.
- Shh! Sorry.
- And that's why God causes train wrecks.
- Ah! My dad is very sick.
What's gonna happen if he dies? Well, if he's been good, he'll go to heaven.
In heaven, you get to do Whatever you like best all the time.

Oh.
Well, I could use a good laugh.
Well, there's nothing funny about What you're about to go through.
I know.
I'm in the zipper club myself.
- Ahh! - You seem okay.
Yeah? Well, I got news for ya.
This ain't makeup.
They say the greatest tragedy is when a father outlives his son.
I've never fully understood why that is.
Frankly, I can see an upside to it.
[ Laughing .]
We passed this card around at work.
- Gee, thanks, guys.
- They had a hell of a time replacing ya.
When I first heard about the operation, I was against it.
But then I thought, if Homer wants to be a woman, so be it.
Barney, I'm not getting a sex change! What? Well, what the hell am I supposed to do with this jumbo thong bikini? Uh, Homer, I snuck you in a beer for old times' sake.
Thanks, Moe.
Uh, you know, Homer, that beer ain't free.
Mom, this is fascinating.
Did you know that they'll stop Dad's heart for six whole minutes? [ Groans .]
I don't know if I like you reading all those cardiology books.
No, Mom.
It's very reassuring.
And I've learned a great deal from this cow's heart I got at the butcher shop.
- [ Groans .]
- [Man.]
Insert the retractor and crank it until the ribs swing open like a rusty drawbridge.

- [People Applauding.]
Oh, no! No! Someone taped over the end of this! All we ask is to be treated with dignity and respect.
And a new candle now and then? - Yes, and a new ca-- No! - [People Laughing.]
Oh, my little Maggie.
I may never hold you again.
Ew! Stinky pants! Now, Marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're gonna be lonely-- - Oh, Homie, I could never remarry.
- Darn right.
And to make sure, I want to be stuffed and put on the couch - as a constant reminder of our marital vows.
- Ohh.
Kids? You can come in now.
Bed goes up-- Kids I want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens.
Let's see.
Uh-- - Oh, I'm no good at this.
- [ Whispering .]
Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won't get to see you grow up, because-- [ Whispering .]
I know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Lisa-- [ Whispering .]
I guess this is the time to tell you-- - [ Whispering .]
-you're adopted and I don't like you.
Bart! But don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you.
[ Sobbing .]
Oh, Dad.
- Hi, everybody! - Hi, Dr.
Nick! - [ Snoring .]
- Now, if something should go wrong let's not get the law involved.
One hand washes the other.
Ooh, that reminds me.
These gloves came free with my toilet brush.
What the hell is that? Marge, this is Andre.
Hello.
[ Chuckles .]
I think you two would make a lovely couple.
My husband is still alive! Oh.
Thank God.
I hope he pulls through.
Not me.
[ Chuckles .]
Let's have a minute of silent prayer for our good friend, Homer Simpson.
- How long has it been? - Six seconds.
- Do we have to start over? - Hell, no.
Poor Mr.
Homer.
Could it be that my snack treats - are responsible for his wretched health? - Gimme some jerky.
- Would you like some vodka with that? - Oh, what the hell.
Sure.
Doctor, what's wrong? Don't you know where to make the incision? All right, Nick.
Don't panic.
Think back to med school.
Seriously, baby.
I can prescribe anything I want.
I know I'm supposed to cut something, but what? And where? Hey! The incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage! - Below! - Thanks, little girl! [ Singing .]
Uh-oh.
Goodnews! The operation was a complete success.
Oh, that's wonderful! Mmm! Hmm.
## [ Humming .]
Dr.
Nick Riviera, remember me? Well if it isn't my old friend Mr.

I hear they're sending 'em to one of those southern states where the governor's a crook.
Either way, I'm sleeping good tonight.
- Well, sir, where shall we dump this batch? The playground? - No.

Oh, and, uh, I'll take that statue of Justice too.

Oh, Andy Capp.

[ Beeping .]
Aah! Oh! Bart, we'll do anything you want.
just call off your giant mechanical ants! Aah! Whoa! [ Laughing Evilly.]
Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of.
- Like a giant billboard that says, "No fat chicks"? - No! [ Chattering .]
It looks like everyone in Springfield showed up for this.
- [Glass Shattering.]
- [Man.]
Ha-ha! Could this town be any stupider? Order! Please rise for the, uh, Pledge of Allegiance.
- Get to the money! - In a moment.
First, let's review the minutes from our last meeting.
- Get to the money! - Get to the money! - Get to the money! - Very well.
We will now hear suggestions for the, uh, disbursement of the, uh, two million dollars.
Don't you mean three million dollars? Of course.
How silly of me.
Excuse me.
We could use the money to hire firemen - to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town.
- Boring! Hello.
My name is Mr.
Snrub and I come from, uh, someplace far away.
Yes, that will do.
Anyway I-I say we invest that money back in the nuclear plant.
I like the way Snrub thinks.
[ Angry Muttering .]
Pardon me, but I would like to see this money spent on more police officers.
I have been shot eight times this year and as a result, I almost missed work.
- Crybaby.
- My name is Marge Simpson, and I have an idea.
- It may sound a little boring at first.
- [Quimby.]
Chat a way.
I'll just amuse myself with some pornographic playing cards.
Oh.
Well, Surely you've all noticed the terrible condition Main Street is in.
Many of us have destroyed it By leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
- [ Dissonant Chords .]
- Whoo-hoo! Look at that pavement fly! [Marge.]
And those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
Ho! Now hold on just one minute.
Sure, we could fix up Main Street.
We could put all our eggs in one basket.
[ Cheering .]
Shut up! I wasn't done yet.
I'm just saying we could blow all our money on a stupid little street, but-- - [ Cheering, Shouting .]

The name's Lanley, Lyle Lanley and I come before you good people tonight with an idea.
Probably the greatest-- Ah, it's not for you.
It's more of a Shelbyville idea.
Now wait just a minute.
We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville.
just tell us your idea, and we'll vote for it.
All right.
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll show you my idea.
- I give you the Springfield Monorail! - [All Gasping.]
I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook and by gum, it put them on the map! Well, sir, there's nothing on earth like a genuine, bona fide electrified, six-car monorail.
- What'd I say? - Monorail! - What's it called? - [ Together.]
Monorail! - That's right, monorail! - [ All .]
Monorail.
Monorail.
Monorail.
I hear those things are awfully loud.
It glides as softly as a cloud.
Is there a chance the track could bend? Not on your life, my Hindu friend.
What about us brain-dead slobs? You'll be given cushy jobs.
Were you sent here by the devil? No, good sir.
I'm on the level.
The ring came off my pudding can! Take my pen knife, my good man.
I swear it's Springfield's only choice.
Throw up your hands and raise your voice.
- ## [ All Singing .]
- What's it called? - ## [ All Singing .]
- Once again! [ All Singing .]
But Main Street's still all cracked and broken.
Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken.
[ All Singing .]
Monorail! Mono-- D'oh! [ Bart, Homer.]
Monorail! Monorail! Monorail! I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.
- Well, you should have written a song like that guy.
- [ Groans .]
Thank you for coming, Mr.
Lanley.
I'm Miss Hoover.
Miss Hoover? That is hard to believe.
Oh, you.
[ Chuckles .]
I'm here to answer any questions you children have about the monorail.
- Me! - Me! - Can it outrun The Flash? - You bet.
Can Superman outrun The Flash? Uh, sure.
Why not? Hello, little girl.
Wondering if your dolly can ride the monorail for free? Hardly.
I'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
[ Chuckles .]
Young lady that's the most intelligent question I've ever been asked.
- Really? - Oh, I could give you an answer.
But the only ones who'd understand it would be you and me and that includes your teacher.
[ Giggling .]
Next question.
You there, eating the paste.
[ Male Announcer.]
Coming soon, it's Truckasaurus: The Movie starring Marlon Brando as the voice of John Truckasaurus.
You crazy car.
I don't know whether - to eat you or kiss you.
- [ Announcer.]
Celebrity voice impersonated.
- [ Lanley .]
Are you stuck in a dead-end job? - Maybe.
Are you squandering the precious gift Of life in front of the idiot box? - What's it to you? - Are you on your third beer of the evening? Does whiskey count as beer? Well, maybe it's time you joined the exciting field of monorail conducting by enrolling at the Lanley Institute.
[ Man .]
Actual institute may not match photo.
Marge, I wanna be a monorail conductor.
- Homer, no.
- It's my lifelong dream.
Your lifelong dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game and you did it last year, remember? Oh, yeah.
Good evening.
Before we begin, is anyone here an investigative reporter? - I am, and she is.
- Well, I'd like you to please leave.
- Should we take our hidden camera? - Would you? Let's go, Phil.
True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail.
Mmm, false.
No, wait.
Maybe it's true.
No, you were right.
It's false.
- Wow.
You really are gonna be a monorail conductor.
- That's right, boy.
You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job.
- [ Chuckles .]
Kids.
- But now, I wanna follow in your footsteps.
Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju.
I'll get back to you.
Come on! Keep it comin'! Over.
Over.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Hi, Homer! Oh, I hate that sound.
According to this book, the monorail goes over 1 50 miles an hour.
- What if something goes wrong? - What if? What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed! It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
We monorail conductors are a crazy breed half in love with death, gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts.
- Am I turning you on? - No.
- What if I undo this button? - Good night, Homer.
[ Deep Voice .]
What if I talk like this? What if I sing to you? [Homer Singing.]
Mmm, chicken.
[Smacking Lips.]
So then, "mono" means "one," and "rail" means "rail.
" And that concludes our intensive three-week course.
Hey, wait, man.
Who gets to be conductor? Oh, right, that.
Well, I've been monitoring your progress closely.
- But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.
- Who, me? - Yeah, sure.
- Whoo-hoo! After an exhaustive search, Springfield has found its monorail conductor-- Homer Simpson.
And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage or, if you will, cupcake.
Wow, Dad.
You really know your monorails.
[ Squeaking, Hissing .]
Homer, there's a family Of possums in here.
- I call the big one Bitey.
- [ Groans .]
I'm going to see Mr.
Lanley.
Mr.
Lanley? Mr.
Lanley? [ Gasps .]
Oh! - How much did you see? - Uh, nothing incriminating.
- Good.
- Well, bye.
- [Door Closes.]
- I don't know why I leave this lying around.
I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook.
Is there a chance the track could bend? I call the big one Bitey.

- Excuse me, miss.
You asked about the monorail? - Who are you? - My name is Sebastian Kobb.
Lanley hired me to build his monorail.
He cut corners everywhere-- bad wiring, faulty brakes.
And the celebrity on the maiden voyage was Gallagher.
This is all that's left of one of the crappiest trains ever built.
Mr.
Kobb, what can we do? You just better have a damn good conductor.
I locked my keys in there.

I'd say this vessel could do at least warp five.
[ Laughter, Applause .]
And let me say "May the force be with you.
" - Do you even know who I am? - I think I do.
Weren't you one Of the Little Rascals? Mr.
Lanley! Aren't you gonna ride the monorail? Little lady, I'd love to, but I have to catch a plane.
- The ride only takes a minute.
- Yeah, well, my plane leaves in less than one minute.

- [Engine Powering Up.]

Well, we'll just see about that.
Let's go to town hall.
Fine! Should we take one car, or should I follow you? - [ All Screaming .]

You need to find an anchor of some sort.
Think harder, Homer.

I'll take that.

While we're waiting for our pie let's take a minute to remember Great-Aunt Gladys.
Wait a minute.
That was Prince of Tides.
Five, six seven, eight.
- What are you kids playing? - Counting game.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Nine [Minister.]
He was a good man.
He was a kind man.
He gave to his community - and asked little in return.
- [Footsteps.]
- He never-- - [ Whispering, Indistinct .]
That's a woman? Dear Lord! [ Embarrassed Chuckle .]
Well, I guess most of what I said can be salvaged.
Take a seat, bozo.
And that eulogy better not show up on the bill.
I'll keep this short.
Gladys lived alone, died alone.
I guess you could say she was a role model for Selma and me.
- She wasn't a rich woman-- - [ People Muttering .]
but she was rich in spirit.
Forgot my hat.
Don't hassle the dead, boy.
They have eerie powers.

Boy, am I hungry.
I mean I'm really, really hungry.
It's just not fair, damn it! [ Sobbing .]

To my executor, Lionel Hutz I leave $50,000.
Mr.

You really would.
To Marge, I leave my collection of potato chips that resemble celebrities.
They're all here-- Otto von Bismarck Maurice Chevalier, right up to Jay Leno.
These chips were my children, Marjorie.
- Take special care of them.
- [ Crunching .]
Uh-oh.
To my sister, Jackie, I leave my pet iguana, JubJub.
Why didn't she just leave me the bowel obstruction that killed her? To my dear childless nieces, Patty and Selma I leave my grandfather clock and these words: Don't die lonely like me.
Raise a family, and do it now.
[Echoing.]
Now! Now! Now! Hey, a grandfather clock.
Not bad.
[Chiming, Ticking.]

There's something missing in our lives.
Don't worry.
We'll get that "barking dog" record tomorrow.
Patty, I want a baby.

This is all my fault, Dad.
I didn't want you to get hurt.
Now I need to find another little brother.
And I need to find another big brother.
My car's gonna feel so empty on the ride home.
And me, I have no ride at all.
I already bought a giant ham for dinner.
It's gonna go to waste.
Don't talk about food.
I'm so hungry.
- Well, good-bye.
- Well, good-bye.
Wait.
I've got an idea.
- An idea? - Huh? - Another beer, Dad? - Thanks, son.
Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, "I'm a hemophiliac" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back? [ Chuckling .]
Yeah? Will you teach me how to do that? Sure, boy.
First, you gotta shriek like a woman.
And keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust.
That's when it's time to kick some back.
-And then when he's lying out on the ground-- - Yeah? - Kick him in the ribs.
- Yeah? -Step on his neck.
- Yeah? -And run like hell.
-[Both Laughing.]

Doin' a monster song with ya on this beautiful Valentine's Day.
[MaleAnnouncer#2.]
Marty, why did you play that song today? There must be thousands of love songs.
[Marty.]
Well, it's kind of a love song--all the monsters enjoying each other's company-- dancing, holding their evil in check.
- [Announcer#2.]
You played the wrong record, didn't you? - Why are you doing this to me? Bah! This is just another Hallmark holiday cooked up to sell cards.
Ohh.
A valentine from my granddaughter.
[ Meek Voice .]
Could I have the envelope? "To Moe-- from your secret admirer.

And this is for my Huggy Bug, in honor of this special day.

She's getting impatient.
Take a stab at it.
Happy Valentine's Day.

How much? - One hundred dollars.
What? That's highway robbery.
I won't pay it.

First we're going to construct paper mailboxes to store the valentines.
- Isn't that just pointless busywork? - Bull's-eye.
Get cracking.
- Yes, Ralph? - My parents won't let me use scissors.
- [Kids Snickering.]
- The children are right to laugh at you, Ralph.
These things couldn't cut butter.
Now, take out your red crayons.

- Why not? - I ate it.

Attention, everyone.
This is Principal Skinner.

Well, let me tell you something.
Valentine's Day is no joke.
- Sending your chick a valentine, huh? - Yep.

[ Drunken Voice .]
Everyone's always kissing your ass.
Well, I'm not afraid to tell you you're a-- [ Bleep .]
- Oh, I'd give anything to go to that show.
- I'd sell my firstborn son.
- Hey! - You'll do as you're told.
Ralph thinks I like him, but I only gave him a valentine 'cause I felt sorry for him.
Ah, sweet pity.
Where would my love life have been without it? What do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested? - Well, honey-- - Let me handle this, Marge.
I've heard 'em all.
"I like you as a friend.
" "I think we should see other people.
" - "I no speak English.
" - I get the idea.
"I'm married to the sea.
" "I don't wanna kill you, but I will.
" Honey! Honey, I'd tell this boy that you're very flattered but you're just not ready for this kind of thing.
- Thanks, Mom.
- And if that doesn't work, six simple words: "I'm not gay, but I'll learn.
" Ralph, I think you're nice, but I'm just not ready for this kind of thing.
- Do you understand? - I guess so.
Good.
Dad, how do you get a girl to like you? Son, whether you want to win a girl or crack a nut, the key is persistence.
Keep at it and never lose your cool.
[ Grunting .]
- Aw, come on, ya stupid-- - [ Gunfire .]
Let that be a lesson to the rest of you nuts.
Okay, Dad.
I'll be persistent.
Is that how you got Mom? Well, son, never underestimate the appeal of a man in uniform.
Ohh, yeah.

And you know where those reviewers are? All dead.
How you doin' down there, fellas? Huh? Huh? - Anyway, here's a clip.
- Now why do they call this a urine monkey? Uh-- Ohh.
I just found out.
That's funny for so many reasons.
We have to go to that show.
Forget it.
To get those tickets, our parents would have to be part of Springfield's cultural elite.
Can you believe Flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush? - Eww.
- [Doorbell Rings.]
[ Gasps .]
Oh, no! It's Ralph! just make up some excuse.
- She's in the can.
Go away.
- Yes, sir.
- I'd do anything for Lisa.
- Really? Mr.
Simpson, the tar fumes are making me dizzy! Yeah, they'll do that.
"Dearest Martha, Since boyhood "I have yearned to be on the one-dollar bill, and with your help "this I shall achieve.
Sincerely, George Washington.

- Thank you, Rex.
I've selected the cast for our Presidents' Day Pageant.
- Martha Washington will be played by Lisa Simpson.
- [ Giggles .]
George Washington will be played by [Clears Throat.]
Ralph Wiggum.
- Hmm.
- What? This is a travesty! Everyone knows I'm the best actor in this ridiculous school! - Sit down, Rex.
- I will not sit down.
- Someone's gotten to you, you deceitful cow! - That's absurd, Rex.
Ralph won the part fair and square.
That's the signal.
Take the boot off the car, boys.
[ Both Chuckling .]
Now Ralph is in the play with me.
I just know he's gonna embarrass me in front of the whole school.
- [Knocking.]
- Huh? [Running Footsteps.]
Ohh, no.
It's a package from Ralph.
Ohh.
A Malibu Stacy convertible! "Look in the tunk.
" He must mean "trunk.
" [ Gasps .]
Tickets to the Krusty anniversary show! Oh, he must want me to go with him.
Oh, it isn't fair.
I'm 1 0 times the Krusty fan you are.
I even have the Krusty Home Pregnancy Test.
I'm not sure I should go.
I don't even like him.
You're right, Lise.
You shouldn't go.
It wouldn't be honest.
I'll go, disguised as you.
-What if he wants to hold hands? -I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
- What if he wants a kiss? - I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
- What if he-- - You don't wanna know how far I'll go.
Dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like? Sure, it is, honey.
You do mean stealing, don't you? Well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, But my conscience is bothering me.
Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do.
Homer, that's a terrible thing to say.
- Oh, shut up.
- Yes, sir.
I am so glad you cho-cho-chose to come.
[ Chuckles Weakly.]
I think you should give that a rest, Ralph.
- Chief Wiggum, how'd you ever get these tickets? - Krusty knows how to play ball.
[ Neon Buzzing .]
Ahh.
Nothin' beats a good porno movie.
- Chief Wiggum, is this a bust? - Uh, yeah that's just what it is-- a bust.
- That story isn't suitable for children.
- Really? - I keep my pants on in this version.
- Eww.
- [Drumroll.]
- [Announcer.]
It's the Krusty the Clown - 29th Anniversary Show! - [Applause.]

- Send it this way, boy.
- Whoops.
- Ohh.
Aww.
Nothing gets chocolate out.
See? I've worked with some marvelous second bananas over the years but none more memorable than Sideshow Raheem.
Uh, the script says I'm supposed to bonk you with this.
- I wouldn't.
- Right on.
[ Growls Softly.]
Angry.
Angry young man.
Now, for my favorite part of the show.
Whuzzat say? "Talk to the audience"? Oh, God.
This is always death.
- All right.
- Oh, no.
Please don't show me with Ralph.
- What's your name, son? - Ralph.
- [ Whimpers .]
- And is this your girlfriend, Ralph? Yes.
I love Lisa Simpson, and when I grow up, I'm going to marry her! No-o-o-o! Now, you listen to me! I don't like you! I never liked you! And the only reason I gaveyou that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would! Watch this, Lise.

Hey, come to think of it, she did.
Well, she didn't reckon with the awesome power of the chief of police.
Now, where did I put my badge? Hey, that duck's got it! - [ Quacking .]
- Oh, come on.
Come on.
Give it back.
I need it.

You know, one day, honest citizens are gonna stand up to you crooked cops.
They are? Oh, no! Have they set a date? This orange drink is the only way to recoup our terrible losses from Fire Drill Follies.
I just don't know what went wrong.
You opened the show with a fire drill, and everyone cleared out.
Mm.
So Mother was right.
It was my fault.
Go ahead.
Water it down some more.

Are you sure? Well, everyone's talking about it.

Heh.
We're proud of all Of our Duff commercials but here's a very special one from 1 960.
Well, I would suggest, Mr.

[ Announcer.]
And now a word from our sponsor.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my fondness for Duff beer.
[ Studio Audience Cheering .]
I'd, uh, also like to express my fondness for that particular beer.

The man never drank a Duff in his life.
Well, and here we have Duff, Duff Lite and our newest flavor-- Duff Dry.
What does the future hold for Duff? [ Chuckles .]
Let's just say we've got a few ideas up our sleeve.
- Like what? - Uh-- I'd rather not get into it right now.
- Why not? - All right.
We don't have any ideas for the future.
- We got nothing.
Happy? - No.

Hello, Ned! - My name is Ned.

Hello, Ned! It's been 4,000 days since my last drink.
It was my first-- and last-- blackberry schnapps.
Ned, did you clip Ann Landers today? - [ Chuckles .]
Ann Landers is a boring old biddy.
- [ Gasps .]
Ned! I was more animal than man! [ Sobbing .]
My name is Otto.
I love to get blotto.

- My name is Hans.
Drinking has ruined my life.
I'm 31 years old.
My name is Homer, and I'm just here because the court made me come.
Homer, with our help, you'll never touch a beer again.
[ Shrieks .]
[ Brushing Teeth, Spits .]
So they say I might have a problem.
[ Scoffs .]
Homie, do you ever drink alone? - Does the Lord count as a person? - No.
- Then, yes.
- [Groans.]
- Do you need a beer to fall asleep? - Thank you.
That'd be nice.
Do you ever hide beer around the house? Do I ever! Ah! - [Pop-top Fizzes.]
- Do you ever drink to escape from reality? [ Humming Cancan .]
- Homie.
I'd like you to do something for me.
- You name it.
I want you to give up beer for a month.
You got it.
No deer for a month.
Did you say "beer" or "deer"? - Deer.
- Please, Homie.
I know you can do this.
All right.
Starting tomorrow, no beer for a month.
- [Pop-top Fizzes.]
- What was that noise? I was saying, "Psst! I love you.
'" - Bart, could you go get the cupcakes? - Cupcakes! Cupcakes! Yes.
Sweet cakes for all.
[ Whimpering .]
Well, beer, we've had some great times.

Huh? She'll pay for this.
I'm gonna crush her like this pellet.

- Looking for something? - What have you done with my report? I've hidden it.
To find it, you'll need to decipher a series of clues, each more fiendish-- - Got it.
- D'oh! Behold gravity in all its glory! Pretty lame, Milhouse.
- Can I touch it? - I've worked too long and hard on this for you to screw it up now.
- But it's got my name on it.
-Just stand over there.
Over there! Behold the flying machine that will carry me Phileas Fogg, around the world in 80 days.

Dang! I was aimin' for his head.

Step right up, folks! We'll answer the question that has been plaguing scientists for ages: Can hamsters fly planes? -[Crowd Murmuring Adoringly.]
-[Man.]
Oh, look.
He's got miniature goggles on.
- Aw.
And a little scarf.
Isn't that adorable! - Oh! But this project has no scientific merit! - Take a hike, sister.

And now there's a beach ball on the field and the ball boys are discussin' which one of them's gonna go get it.
I never realized how boring this game is.
I think I've lost weight.
You've never looked better.
[Patty.]
Thank you all for coming.
We've got some very interesting developments in the field of Supperware.
Uh-huh.
This is the 1 28-ounce tub.
You can fit your whole head in it.

Don't be scared, JubJub.
It's Mama.
I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
So, Homer, please feel free to tell us anything.
There's no judgment here.
The other day, I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
- [ All Gasp .]

You don't have to start drinking right away.
I was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
But, Marge, the barflies are expecting me-- Moe and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill.
But you look better.
You don't sweat while you eat anymore.
And look.
You've saved more than a hundred dollars.

Come on, Homer.
Do it for your old pal, Moesy.
But, Moe, yesterday, you called Homer a worthless sack of-- - Pipe down, rub-a-dub! - Ow.
Put it in the fridge, Moe.
I've got a date with my wife.

Of course I'll be back.

- Smithers, where's that union representative? He's 20 minutes late.
Uh, I don't know, sir.
He hasn't been seen since he promised to clean up the union.
Whoa! What the hell? Well, let's look at the contract ourselves, eh? Benefits, perks, a green cookie on St.
Patrick's Day? Oh-ho, it didn't use to be this way, Smithers.
No, it didn't use to be this way at all.
Come on, come on! Crack those atoms! You, turn out those pockets! Atoms.
One, two, three, four-- Six of them! Take him away! You can't treat the workingman this way! One day, we'll form a union and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve.
Then we'll go too far and get corrupt and shiftless and the Japanese will eat us alive! The Japanese? Those sandal-wearing goldfish tenders? [ Laughs .]
Bosh! Flimshaw! If only we had listened to that boy instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven.
Well, I am going to avenge my grandfather.
We'll take on that greedy union and we'll get back our dental plan.
- How often do you brush, Ralph? - Three times a day, sir.
Why must you turn my office into a house of lies? You're right! I don't brush! [ Crying .]

Maggie's teeth are coming in crooked.
Has she been sucking on a pacifier? - Uh not to my knowledge.
- Liar! I'm also afraid little Lisa is going to need braces.
Oh, no! I'll be socially unpopular.
- More so.
- Are you sure, Doctor? Well, judge for yourself.
Here's Lisa today.
Without treatment, here's what she'll look like at age 11 age 14, age 17 and, finally, age 18.
- [ Gasps .]
- Cool! She'll be a freak.
Bart! We can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the South and charge two bits a gander.

Homer, Lisa needs braces.
Don't worry.
We won a dental plan in the strike of'88.
That's where I got this scar.
What do we want? More equitable treatment in the hands of management! - [Carl.]
When do we want it? - [All.]

Welcome, brothers ofLocal643.
As you know, our president, Chucky Fitzhugh, ain't been seen lately.
We're all praying he'll turn up soon, alive and well.
Oh, all right, all right.
But seriously, we have to vote on Burns's new contract.
It's basically the same deal, except we get a free keg of beer for our meetin'.
[ All .]
Yea! In exchange for that, we have to give up our dental plan.
So long, dental plan! - [Lenny's Voice.]
Dental plan! - [Marge's Voice.]
Lisa needs braces.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
Bull's-eye! [ Chortles .]
Thanks a lot, Carl.
Now I've lost my train of thought.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
- Dental plan! - Lisa needs braces.
If we give up our dental plan I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces! People, stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without that dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth.
- Yoink! - Hey! And, Gummy Joe, where would you be without that dental plan? Well, I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure.
You know what I think of this contract? - This! [ Angry Grunting .]
- [ Cheering .]
Yeah! - Who is that firebrand, Smithers? - That's Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh? New man? Actually, sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor you ran over his son, he saved the plant from meltdown and his wife painted you in the nude-- Eh, doesn't ring a bell.
[ Chanting .]
Homer! Homer! Homer! I move that Homer Simpson be our new union president.
- All in favor? - Aye! - All opposed? -[Man.]
Nay.
- Congratulations, Homer.
- [ Cheering .]
- Hey, what does this job pay? - Nothin'.
- D'oh! - Unless you're crooked.
Whoo-hoo! President of the union? I'm so proud of you, Homie.
This is your chance to get a fair shake for the workingman.
And make lifelong connections to the world of organized crime.
Hmm.
Organized crime.
Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you.
Mmm.
Grazie.
Don Homer, my son, he has a-trouble with the-- Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh.
Moltobene.
That's a nice a-donut.
Do you think you can get the dental plan back? Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator-- Mr.
Burns or me.
Dad, I'll trade you this delicious doorstop for your crummy old Danish.
Done and done! [ Laughing .]
D'oh! Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession for Teeth.
[ Sniffing .]
Hmm! Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now so we'll need something a little more affordable.
These predate stainless steel so you can't get them wet.
[ Coughs .]
Hmm, he's a worthy foe.
Look at him, Smithers.
Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine.
[ Grunting .]
Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back? Okay, but it's the last time.
Mmm! We don't have to be adversaries, Homer.
We both want a fair union contract.
[ Thinking .]
Why is Mr.
Burns being so nice to me? And if you'll scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Wait a minute.
Is he coming on to me? I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm? Oh, my God! He is coming on to me.
After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows.
- [ Chortling, Clicks Tongue .]
- [ Silent Scream .]
Sorry, Mr.
Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans.
Sure, I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no.
[ Sighs .]
Lisa, so you won't be scared I'll show you some of the tools I'll be using.
This is the scraper, this is the poker and this happy little fellow is the gouger.
- [ Loud Whirring .]

Now, the first thing I'll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jaw bone.
Hold still while I gas you.

Look, fellas! It's Lisa in the sky! No diamonds though.
Look out for the campy drawing of Queen Victoria! Oh, no! - God, help us! - Help us.

[ Sinister Chortling .]
Ah, Homer, I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you.
You know, you could have just called me.
Oh, yes, but the telephone is so impersonal.
I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons.
Hired goons? This is the largest TV in the free world.
Â¡Ay, un gatomalodoro! [ Disgusted Shudder.]

- Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.
Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it.
- Now, let's get down to business.
- [ Thinking .]
Oh, man! I have to go to the bathroom.
Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon? Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking, and I want to take the pressure off.
It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one.
Well, listen tome, and you'll make a big splash very soon.
- Oh! Which way to the bathroom? - Oh, it's the 23rd door on the left.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
[ Sighs .]
He wouldn't even hear me out.
- [ Groans .]
- Find the bathroom all right? Uh yeah.
Well, you've won this round, Simpson but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug! [ Laughing .]
Aah! Ohh! Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back.
A bug, I tell you! A bug! [ Laughing .]
[ Groans, Laughs .]
[ Sighs .]
I'm gonna resign.
I don't know why they made me union president in the first place.
Because they love you down at the plant.
Yeah, you're right.
Guys are always patting my bald head for luck pinchin' my belly to hear my girlish laugh.
Hmm.
That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
You're right.
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head.
[ Slurps, Grunts .]
Batten down those cowlicks.
Straighten that part.
Uncross those eyes, mister.
- But I can't! - Oh, sorry, Quigley.
Come on, honey.
Smile! I bet you've got a beautiful smile.
Why don't you share it with the world? - [ Gasps .]
There is no God! -[Shutter Clicks.]

Smithers, get me some strikebreakers, the kind they had in the '30s.
We can't bust heads like we used to - but we have our ways.
- [ Murmuring Agreement .]
One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville.
I needed a new heel for my shoe so I decided to go to Morganville which is what they called Shelbyville in those days.
So I tied an onion to my belt which was the style at the time.
Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel.
And in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em.
"Give me five bees for a quarter," you'd say.
Now, where were we? Oh, yeah! The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt which was the style at the time.
They didn't have white onions because of the war.
The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones.
[ Shouting .]
Full power, Smithers.
[ Yells, Whimpering .]
[ Folk Ballad Continues .]
Now do "Classical Gas.
" Ooh, look at him strutting around Like he's cock of the walk.
Well, let me tell you, Homer Simpson is cock of nothing! - Hmm? - Why, you and I can run this plant ourselves.
Crush! Kill! Destroy! Tonight on Smartline, the power plant strike-- argle-bargle or foofaraw? With us tonight are plant owner C.
M.
Burns union kingpin Homer Simpson and talk show mainstay Dr.
Joyce Brothers.
- I brought my own mike! - Yes.
Well.
Homer, organized labor has been called a lumbering dinosaur.
[ Screams .]
My director is telling me not to talk to you anymore.
- Whoo-hoo! - Mr.
Burns, you mentioned you wanted an opening tirade.
Yes, thank you, Kent.
Fifteen minutes from now, I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city! No one will be spared! No one! A chilling vision of things to come.
[ Dings .]
- Oh, for God's sake! - [ Whimpers .]
Good-bye, Springfield! From hell's heart, I stab at thee! [ Excited Shouting .]

Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing.
They're not sad at all.
They're actually singing! They sing without juicers.
They sing without blenders.
They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Ooh! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal.
All right, Homer, you can have the dental plan on one condition-- you must resign as head of the union.
Whoo-hoo! [ Whooping .]
Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.
[ Whooping .]
- We're going back to work! - [ All Cheering .]
[ All .]
Yea! Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces! And that's the tooth! Oops.

I won't jump anymore.

You're a veterinarian? That's right.
And for an extra $20 I'll give Homer a tick bath and then spay him.
- Here you go, Doc.
- Bart! Shop around.
You can't beat that price.
You guys must have been pretty worried about me? Hey, we know you're tough, Dad.
Remember that time you got lost in the forest? This is a trap.
It's gonna catch us our dinner.
Come on, boy.
Shh! Just watch.
Ooh! Aha! Got 'em! [Thud.]
Okay, okay.
This time I'll just go into the bushes over there make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit.
- And when he comes out, you step on him.
- Right, Dad.

But our marriage has been through hard times, and we always pull through.
Huh? Huh? Hmm? Marge! What a lovely surprise.
- You're here to see me, right? - Of course.
- [Men Cheering, Applauding.]
- [ Kiss .]
Hey, way to go, Homer! Way to go! Hey, what'll I tell the boss? Tell him I'm going to the backseat of my car with the woman I love and I won't be back for 1 0 minutes! [Cheering, Applauding.]
- You can do it, Homer.
Standup.
- I can't.
[ Sighs .]
He just won't budge.
I've tried everything.
Nothing can reach him.
Mmm.
Chocolate.
[Thinking.]
Chocolate.
Chocolate.
Mmm! [ Barks, Whimpering .]
Wow! Chocolate.
Half price.
[ Moaning .]
Chocolate.
[Moaning.]
[ Growls, Yelling .]
Can't breathe.
Sweet chocolate cutting off air.
[ Gagging .]
Mmm! Nuts.
[ Gagging .]
[Gagging Continues.]
[Swallows.]
Oh, yeah! Poor Homer.
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
[ Drooling .]
[ Yells .]
Kill it! Kill it! - Grampa, please.
He's in a coma.
- Coma? Pfftt.
Why, I go in and out of comas all the-- [ Snores .]
French toast, please.
- Is a coma painful? - Oh, heck no! You relive long-lost summers, kiss girls from high school.
It's like one of those TV shows where they show a bunch of clips from old episodes.
Mm.
Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he's thinking now? [ Snoring .]
This man is costing my health plan $5,000 a day.
I demand that he die with dignity.
- [ Grunts .]
- Now, look, I'm the doctor here.
Well, I demand a second opinion.
- Hi, everybody! - [ All .]
Hi, Dr.
Nick.
- [ Whimpers .]
- Oh, dear.
I see no signs of life.
-Just to be safe, we better pull the plug.
- Yoink! Mr.
Burns, how can you be so coldhearted? You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through.
Uh, Mr.
Burns, I need to borrow some money.
- Oh, please, do go on.
- I know you're a good man.
And I have a dog that's very sick.
Oh, please, continue.
I thought maybe you-- Oh.
- Well, thanks for your time.
- Hmm.
I have an unorthodox solution-- a fantastic voyage, if you will.
[ Chuckles .]
Three scientists-- one a beautiful woman-- will be shrunk to microscopic size.
- They will then rendezvous in Mr.
Simpson's lower colon.
- [ All .]
Ew! Well, we have had a little trouble finding volunteers.
[ Chuckles .]
I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad.
But there were times when we really connected.
[Saxophone.]
Hi, Dad.
Want me to cut out this infernal racket? - Oh, let me hear you play.
- Why? Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay? [ Blues .]
Oh.
[ Sobbing .]
- ## [ Upbeat Jazz .]
- Huh? Yeah! That's more like it! Ho ho.
Whoo! [ Singing .]
[Singing Continues.]
I wrote this for you, Dad.
[ Mellow Jazz .]
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I know I haven't been a perfect kid.
- [Rumbling.]
- [ Gasps .]
- Why, you little-- - ## [ Action Movie Theme .]
What the-- D'oh! - [Horn Honking.]
- [ Laughing .]
[Jabbering Incoherently.]
I know that I got you mad once in a while.
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! And sometimes I got into trouble.
[Clanking.]
- Bart, you can't go on like this.
- I know.
[ Coughs .]
But you always looked out for me.
[Marge.]
Homer, it's really coming down! Could you check on the boys? - [ Thunderclap .]
- They're fine.
And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me.
Now come on, you're gonna learn how to shave.
And finally, the little spot under your nose.
Next, we take some toilet paper tear off some teensy little squares and stick one there and there and anyplace you're bleeding.
There and there.
Don't worry.
The blood'll hold it right on your face.
And now, some aftershave.
[ Yelling .]
Son of a-- Ohh! And that's how we shave.
Dad, it's all my fault.
I shook up that can of beer.
It was just an April Fools' joke.
[ Beeping .]
[ Growling .]
[ Beeping Faster.]
- Why, you little-- - [ Gagging .]
- Homie, you're all right! - We're a family again! - [ Gagging .]
- [ Growling .]
This calls for a celebration.
- We're all going to Hawaii.
- [ All Gasping .]
[ Laughing .]
Gotcha! It's April Fools' for two more minutes.
Dad, it's May 1 6.
You were in that coma for seven weeks.
Uh-huh.
[ All Laughing .]
You lost five percent of your brain.
Me lose brain? Uh-oh! [ All Laughing .]
Why I laugh? - [ People Chattering .]
- Shh!

D'oh! [ Screams .]
[ Trumpeting .]
[Applause.]
Mmm! Delicious! Now, Krusty, I hear it's your birthday so I got your mother's recipe for matzohbrei.
Hey, I don't do The Jewish stuff on the air.
But, Hershel, bubbeleh-- Ix-nay on the ew-Jay.
Roll the cartoon.
It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.
Marge, it happened again.
[ Groans .]
[ Grunting Angrily.]
Ohh.
What are you gonna change your name to when you grow up? Lois Sanborn.
Steve Bennett.
[Singing Theme.]
- Ow.
- Hee-hee-hee.
- Ow.
- Hee-hee-hee.
- Ow.
- Hee-hee-hee.
This is a rather lifeless outing.
Don't worry.
They're building to something.
- Oww.
- Hee-hee-hee.
[ Together.]
Kids, say no to drugs! Ehh, I could pull a better cartoon out of my a-- [ Chuckles .]
Hey! Whoa! Wasn't that great, kids? That's as bad as the tasteless "Itchy and Sambo" cartoons of the late '30s.
The writers should be ashamed of themselves.
- Cartoons have writers? - Ehh, sort of.
Oh, yeah? Well, you and I could write a better cartoon than that.
Write a cartoon ourselves? Bart, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Probably not.
Lie in the snow and count to 60.
Hyah! [Sinister Chuckling.]
Merry Christmas, suckers! [Marge.]
"Third notice"? "Final notice"? "Some guys are coming"? Oh, what's this? An invitation to our high school reunion.
Gee, that's odd.
They didn't send one to you.
[ Thinking .]
This is it, Homer.
It's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past.
Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.
Oh, my God! [ Thinking .]
No, the other secret.
Marge, I never graduated from high school.
Well, that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap.
Wait.
Maybe it does.
I never passed Remedial Science 1 -A.
And you're a nuclear technician? Marge, ix-nay on the uclear-nay echnician-tay.
- What did you say? - I don't know.
I flunked Latin too.
According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting.
Okay.
Setting, setting, setting setting.
[ Gasps, Grunts .]
[Snap.]
[ Muttering .]
- How about a barbershop? - Great! Scratchy is getting a haircut.
[Lisa.]
Then Itchy, the barber chops Scratchy's head off with a razor.
[Mexican.]
[Bart, Lisa Laughing.]
Ah, too predictable.
The way I see it, instead of shampoo Itchy covers Scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce opens a box of flesh-eating ants and the rest writes itself.
[ Shrieks .]
Ah, this show ain't no good.
- [ Typing .]
- Finished! Now all we have to do is put our names on it.
- Fine.
Put my name first.
- No way! All right, then to decide it I propose a race around the world.
Meet me at Leicester Square at noon tomorrow.
The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag.
Look, there's only one reasonable way to settle this-- rock, paper, scissors.
[ Thinking .]
Poor, predictable Bart.
Always takes rock.
[ Thinking .]
Good old rock.
Nothing beats that.
- Rock.
- Paper.
D'oh! [Man.]
You call this writing? If I puked in a fountain pen and mailed it to the monkey house, I'd get better scripts.
-But, sir, at Harvard-- -Oh, at Harvard they taught you? Hit the streets, egghead! You should've majored in not getting fired.
Sir, a Lisa and Bart Simpson sent you a script.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Dear Mr.
Meyers, my brother and I watch your show.
You should be proud that children everywhere--" Blah-blah-blah, bling-bling-bling-blah.
Hey, egghead! Sing "Fair Harvard.
" [ Singing .]
You, sir, have the boorish manners of a Yalie! Bart, they rejected our script.
I guess we're just not cut out to be writers.
Maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids.
Let's put a grown-up's name on it.
How about Grampa? He's pretty out of it.
He let those guys use his checkbook for a whole year.
[Rapid Typing.]
[Grampa.]
When I read your magazine I don't see one wrinkled face or a single toothless grin.
For shame! To the sickos at Modern Bride magazine.
Hey, Grampa, we need to know your first name.
[ Gasps .]
You're making my tombstone! No! We're just curious.
All right, let's see.
First name.
First name.
Well, whenever I'm confused I just check my underwear.
It holds the answer to all the important questions.
Call me Abraham Simpson.
Grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants? I don't know! Ehh! Hmm.
[ Chuckling .]
- [Knocking.]
- What? Sir, you locked my office, and I wanted to get my Harvard mug.
- Shut up! - [ Moans .]
[ Laughing .]
Roxie, get me Abraham Simpson.
[Phone Rings.]
- Phone call, Simpson.
- Ehh? Is this the Abraham Simpson who wrote the Itchy and Scratchy episode? Ishi and what? Oh, you must be some kind of crazy person.
I'm sorry, but we have a substantial check here for a Mr.
Abraham Simpson.
That's right.
I did the Iggy.
Ah, my high school yearbook.
You handsome devil.
"I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
" [ Chuckles .]
"Activities: none.
Sports: none.
Honors: none.
" So many memories.
Time to go to the reunion.
It'll be great to see the old gang again-- Potsie, Ralph Malph, the Fonz.
That was Happy Days.
No, they weren't all happy days.
Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle.
Or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks and my dad Tom Bosley had to get it back.
[ Groans .]
Hello, Principal Dondelinger.
Oh, Marge Bouvier.
It's so good to see you.
Sorry, sir.
We're not letting vagrants sleep in the gym tonight.
But we will be putting some scraps by the back door.
- D'oh! - Oh, it's you, Simpson.
Yecch.
[Disco.]
Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown.
I am not a crook! [ Laughs .]
Eh? Richard Nixon.
I know! [ Continues .]
[ Both Grunt, Laugh .]
Oh, my God! - It's my old boyfriend, Artie Ziff.
- ## [ Humming .]
Hello, Marge.
Have you heard? I'm stinking rich.
jealous? I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
- I would.
- Mmm! Homer! Hey, Man, it's Dave! Open up, Man! - Dave's not here, Man.
- [ Laughing .]
Okay, now, let's move on-- The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave! Homer.
- Homer? - Homer's not here, Man.
[ Chuckles .]
Okay, very good.
Now let's get on with our really big show.
- Ed Sullivan.
- Shh! First, the award for the alumnus who's gained the most weight-- - Homer Simpson! - Oh, my God! How'd you do it, Homer? I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
And now the award for most improved odor-- - Homer Simpson.
- Yes! [Applause.]
And the person who traveled the least distance to be here-- Well, kiss my grits! - Homer Simpson! - [Applause.]
- ####[Fanfare.]
- What can I say? It hasn't been easy staying in my rut.
Class of'74, I was just leafing through your permanent records when I discovered something shocking.
Homer Simpson never passed Remedial Science 1 -A and thus never graduated from high school.
- [ All Gasp .]
- I'm sorry, Simpson.
- I have to take back those awards.
- [ All Laughing .]
This is Howard Co-smell.
Homer Simpson is a boob.
What do you think, J.
J.
? Dy-no-mite! Didn't graduate? How low can you get? Barney, where's your cummerbund? It fell in the toilet.
I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma and get back my Most Improved Odor trophy! [ Groans .]
You're a comedy writer? My God, you're so old.
- I want my check! - [ Laughs .]
You're a writer, all right.
- Here you go, Simpson.
- I want another one! You're a funny guy.
How would you like a staff job? I'll start you at $800 a week.
My chest hurts.
All right, leeches, I want you to see what a good writer looks like.
His name is Abraham Simpson and he's got something you couldn't get at your fancy schools-- life experience.
Actually, you know, I wrote my thesis on life experience, and-- Quiet! Abe, tell 'em about your amazing life.
I spent 40 years as a night watchman at a cranberry silo.
Wow! So, this patch steadily releases nicotine into my body eliminating my need for cigarettes.
[ Laughing .]
[ Groaning .]
Roll the cartoon.
[Singing Theme.]
Bart! Our cartoon's on TV! - All right! Turn up the volume! - ## [ TV.]
[ Announcer.]
Erosion is a slow but steady process.
[ Screaming .]
Ah, this show ain't no good.
Hee-yah! [ Plaintive Ballad .]
[Singing End Theme.]
[ Both Sigh .]
Bart, Lisa, I have something to tell you, and I'm not proud of it.
Dad, whatever you say you know you'll always have my love and respect.
I never graduated from high school.
[ Laughing .]
- [ Growling .]
- [ Choking .]
[Doorbell Rings.]
Hello, son.
I was on my way home from work and thought I'd drop by.
Oh.
You have a job? They pay me $800 a week to tell a cat and mouse what to do! I see.
[ Vocalizing .]
[ Bell Rings .]
Dad, can we talk to Grampa alone for a minute? All right.
But if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar.
Then we put your name on the script and sent it in.
Didn't you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing? Didn't you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing? Grampa, we could write the scripts for you and split the money three ways.
I don't know.
I'd better sleep on it.
[ Snoring .]
Grampa? Grampa! [ Gasping .]
Oh, why did you wake me? I was having the nicest dream.
I dreamt I was the queen of the Old West.
I kept a six-shooter in my garter, I did.
- Do we have a deal? - Sure, sure.
[ Snoring .]
Boys, stop! You can both marry me! Whoo-hoo! Yippee! Hey, how would you kids like a tour of the studio? - Yea! - Yea! - Abe, you comin'? - Any stairs? -Just one.
- Nuts to you! [ Snoring .]
Wow, it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons.
Well, we cut corners.
Sometimes to save money our animators will reuse the same backgrounds over and over and over again.
[ Clears Throat .]
Welcome to Remedial Science 1 -A.
My, uh, wife recently passed away.
I thought teaching might ease my loneliness.
- Will this be on the test? - No! Oh! Hey, Mel, bring me another nicotine patch.
Uh, I think there's some space on my butt.
And now, here's another fine Itchy and Scratchy cartoon by Abraham Simpson! [ All Cheering .]
[ Shrieks .]
[ Continues Shrieking .]

Hmph! Hmph! [ Gasps .]
[ All Shouting .]
The bright blue flame indicates this was a particularly sweet doughnut.
[ Sobbing .]
This is not happening.
This is not happening! - [Typing.]
- [Grampa.]
Dear Mr.
President there are too many states nowadays.
Please eliminate three.
I am not a crackpot.
- Good news, Abe.
- Who are you? [ Chuckling .]
No, no.
You've been nominated for an award.
You're so good, I fired the other writers.
From now on, the fate of the entire company rests on that delightful coconut of yours.
Oh, no! We're all doomed! I'm a complete fraud! Huh? Sorry? I didn't catch any of that.
And now I gotta go.
[ Clears Throat .]
All right, here are your exams.
Fifty questions.
- True or false.
- True.
- Homer, I was just describing the test.
- True.
- Homer, just take the test, and you'll do fine.
- False.
[ Sighs .]
All right, brain.
You don't like me, and I don't like you but let's just do this and I can get back to killing you with beer.
[ Thinking .]
It's a deal! Thank you for this award.
It is a tribute to this great country that a man who once took a shot at Teddy Roosevelt could win back your trust.
Yo, Grampa, time for the awards.
Did you call the girl from the escort service? They said their insurance won't cover you.
Oh.
That's an onion in the ointment.
[Orchestra: Upbeat.]
[Emcee.]
Now, to present the award for outstanding writing in a cartoon series Krusty the Clown and Brooke Shields.
[ Applause .]
[Ends.]
"Well, here we are.
The star of The Blue Lagoon and me, the blue-haired goon!" What the-- That's terrible! Cartoons have the power to make us laugh and to make us cry.
Wouldn't you agree, Krusty? First of all, my hair is green, not blue.
I got nothin' to work with here.
- Nothin'! - Uh-- Well, at least I can take off this girdle.
- [Grunting, Sighing.]
- [Girdle Snaps.]
Ohh, yeah! Uh, the nominees for best writing in a cartoon series are Strong-dar, Master of Akom, the wedding episode.
Strong-dar, Master of Akom, the wedding episode.

Please, Mommy.
I want it.
- Hmm.

Ren and Stimpy, season premiere.
[Applause Intensifies.]
And finally, Itchy and Scratchy, the "Little Barbershop of Horrors" episode.
Cross my fingers for me.
- [ Snap .]
- That's gonna hurt come winter.
- [ Shrieks .]
- [ Laughing .]
[ Chuckling .]
And the winner is Itchy and Scratchy, Abraham Simpson-- rise.
[ Gasps .]
- ####[Orchestra.]
- [Bart.]
All right, Grampa! Whoo! That was the first time I ever saw Itchy and Scratchy and I didn't like it one bit! It was disgusting and violent! I think all you people are despicable! For shame! [ Murmuring, Shouting .]
He's right.
We've been wasting our lives.
To hell with cartoons.
I'm gonna do what I've always dreamed of.
Gonna write that sitcom about that sassy robot.
Here, kids.
I guess you deserve this.
Let's go.
I guess nobody likes the truth, huh, Grampa? - Nope.
- [ Bart .]
I'll never watch an awards show again.
Unless that delightful Billy Crystal's involved.
Marge! I passed! That's wonderful, Homie! At our next high school reunion, I'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
Hello, Dondelinger.
Simpson.
Is that a plunger stuck on your head? - D'oh! - [ Groans .]
[ Upbeat .]
Not me! Knock that off, you two! It's time for church! We're not going to church today.
[ Gasps .]
What? You give me one good reason! It's Saturday! Okilly-dokilly-do! - [ People Chattering .]
- Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! Children, we've just been tipped off that Superintendent Chalmers is planning a surprise inspection.
So, let's clean up this pigsty.
Whoa! On another topic, the following students have won mountain bikes.
Bart Simpson, Jimbo Jones Nelson Muntz.
I want you to keep filling your shirt with crud till I get back.
Y-Yes, sir.
You may pick your bikes up in utility basement "B.
" Fools.
- Oops.
Still on.
Hey, what do you think he meant by that "fools" remark? Aw, who cares? Time to get me a mountain bike.
Hey, what gives? Where are the mountain bikes? Sorry about the ruse, gentlemen.
You're being swept under the rug for the superintendent's visit.
Enjoy.
How are we gonna get out of here? And when are we gonna get our mountain bikes? Would the world judge me harshly if I threw away the key? No, but the P.
T.
A.
would tear you a new arse.
Wise counsel, William.
But the potty-talk adds nothing.
Aye, sir.
You bath-taking, underpants-wearing lily hugger.
Superintendent Chalmers, welcome.
- Hello, Seymour.
- So, what's the word down at One School Board Plaza? We're dropping the geography requirement.
The children weren't testing well.
It was proving to be an embarrassment.
Very good.
Back to the three "R's.
" They were the children's idea.
I tried to stop them.
It's always the children's fault, isn't it, Seymour? Yes.
Yes, it is, sir.
Imagine a school out there with no bullies.
Science geeks not getting beat up.
Kids using their lunch money for food.
I can't take it! Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent.
- All right.
- All right, Bart.
Do it, man.
Now, remember, little dude, you're our only hope.
Ow! - Got 'im! - Way to go, man.
May I interest you in a Jell-O brick, sir? There's a grape in the center.
Well, I'm not made of stone.
You're not made of stone.
A brick and you're not made of stone.
Ach, my beauty.
Wait till the superintendent sees you.
Were it not a violation of God's law, I'd make you my wife.
Now thar's a lonely man.
I'm new in town.
Be there a cool loch where a lass could wash her long, red hair? Nay, but there's a pool at me apartment complex.
There was a rat in the deep end.
- But we got 'im! - Ah, lead on.
Forty-eight, 49, 50.
Flag's up-to-date.
Very good, Seymour.
Now, are these children as smart as they look? Well, let's, uh, pick one at random.
Mmm, how about that one? - You mean this boy here? - No! No.
Lisa Simpson.
- When was the Battle of New Orleans? -January 8, 1 81 5.
Two weeks after the war ended.
- First-rate.
- What's a battle? Let's go.
- Did that boy say, "What's a battle?" - He said, "What's that rattle?" - About the heating duct.
- Hmm.
It sounded like battle.
- I've had a cold, so, uh - Oh, so you would hear "R's" as "B's?" - Yes.
- I understand.
Come on, Bart.
Ride me.
I better not.
He's insulting both of us.
Let's go.
Excellent.
Not a trace of urine.
Seymour, you run a tight ship.
Well, you know what they say, sir.
"Where there's no smoke, there's no fire.
" What an odd remark.
Why, that looks like a 50-cent piece.
I'll just bend over and get it.
Seems to be caught between these two flowers.
Ow, ow, ow.
Seymour, I was thinking of promoting you to assistant superintendent.
But, instead, that plum goes to Holloway.
- No.
But, sir, he's a drunk.
- And a pill-popper.
- If I could just - Silence! And why is a cafeteria worker posing as a nurse? - I get two paychecks this way.
- D'oh.
There's no detention this time, Simpson.
This is the end.
You are expelled from Springfield Elementary.
Aw.
Tonight on Eye On Springfield, the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz.
Where are they now? And we'll visit a nudist camp for animals.
But, first, a look at the local holiday that was called distasteful and puerile by a panel of hillbillies, "Whacking Day.
" - Oh, no, no! - In a tradition that dates back to founding father Jebediah Springfield, every May 1 0, local residents gather to drive snakes into the center of town and whack them to snake heaven.
After exposing Alger Hiss Honorary Grand Marshal Richard Nixon goes after another deadly hiss.
Oh! I-Is Whacking Day over? Thank you.
Thanks for coming out.
It's all so barbaric.
Hey, kids, how was school? - I learned how many drams in a pennyweight.
- I got expelled.
That's my boy.
Mmm, beer.
What? Look, Dad, I don't need school.
I'll make my way as a bootblack.
Shine your boots, guv'nor? No son of mine is gonna be a 1 9th-century cockney bootblack.
We're gonna find you another school.
Now, remember, Bart.
This is a religious school - so be very careful about what you say and do here.
- No problemo.
Now, Bart, Since you're new here perhaps you'd favor us with a psalm.
How about "Beans, beans, the musical fruit"? Well, uh, beans were a staple of the Israelites.
Yes, proceed.
Beans, beans, the musical fruit.
The more you eat, the more you toot.
Avert your eyes, children.
He may take on other forms.
I guess that's it.
I just can't be educated.
I can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
We'd like you to try this new diet cola.
- We call it "Nature's Goodness.
" - What's in it? Sweet.
Pleasing taste.
Some "monsterism.
" - Cool.
- You're going to get an education.
- I'm going to teach you myself.
- Marge, it's too late.
The boy's 1 0 years old.
Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one.
- What's your problem? - Whacking Day's coming.
Whoo-hoo! The greatest day of the year.
But killing snakes is evil.
Maybe so, Lisa, but it's part of our oh, so human nature.
Inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved.
I am evil Homer.
I am evil Homer.
I am evil Homer.
I am evil Homer.
Have a nice day at school, Lise.
I'll just try and make the best of a bad situation.
Ahh.
Bart, get dressed for school.
I expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings.
I bought a bell.
I think I'll unplug that.
I'm your new teacher.
My name is Mrs.
Simpson.
I didn't do it.
Oh, that's right.
I invited a guest speaker to talk to the class.
Hello, children.
I got separated from my platoon after we parachuted into DÃ¼sseldorf.
So I rode out the war posing as a German cabaret singer.
Yoo-hoo.
Ach du Liebe! Das ist not eine booby.
- Is that story true, Grampa? - Well, most of it.
I did wear a dress for a period in the '40s.
Oh, they had designers then.
Look what I got, Marge.
A new whacking stick.
- Whack! - Ooh.
- Excuse me.
- Whack, whack, whack! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Bart, I'd like you to read this copy of Johnny Tremain.
- It's a book I read as a girl.
- A book? I think you might like this.
It's about a boy who goes to war.
- His hand is deformed in an accident.
- Deformed? Why didn't you say so? They should call this book "Johnny Deformed.
" Guest director, Oliver Stone.
Oh, God! Get his gun! "Hundreds would die, but not the thing they died for.
A man can stand up.
" Wow! Mm-hmm.
If you'd like to learn more about colonial times we could take a field trip to Olde Springfield Towne.
D'oh! Hi-yah! Dad! Everyone likes Whacking Day, but I hate it.
- Is there something wrong with me? - Yes, honey.
- Then what should I do? -Just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time.
Like that day I hit the referee with a whiskey bottle.
- Remember that? - Yeah.
- When Daddy hit the referee? Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Any experience? - Yes.
I played Panicky Idiot Number Two in The Poseidon Adventure.
Sorry, we're looking for more of a "duh, duh" idiot.
But I see.
Hello, Barney.
Are you playing the town drunk? Actually, I'm supposed to be a governor.
The enemy surrounded the fort and said that if the captain was sent out - the rest would be spared.
- What did they do? - They sent him out.
- Was he killed? And how.
That's why they call it Fort Sensible.
This is Jebediah Springfield at the Battle of Ticonderoga.
Next.
And here he is killing a snake on the very first Whacking Day in 1775.
Hey, wait a minute.
That was the same day he was at Ticonderoga.
How could he be in two places at once? Uh, um You see He'll blow the whole deal.
Get him out of here.
Roger.
If you wanna learn more about Whacking Day there are many fine books in our gift shop.
Welcome to your official Whacking Day headquarters.
I've hidden a snake somewhere in the store.
The first one to whack it, gets a free Squishy.
Hey! Hey! I should've put more thought into my promotion.
- Aim for the body, men.
- Right, Chief.
"And the Lord said, "Whackye all the serpents which crawl on their bellies and thy town shall be a beacon unto others.
" So you see, Lisa, even God himself endorses Whacking Day.
- Let me see that.
- Mmm, no.
Here you go.
Official Whacking Day parking.
Ten dollars per axle.
Whoo-hoo! Take that snake! And you too! Snakes, snakes everywhere.
- Getting ready for Whacking Day? - What's Whacking Day? Did you bring the pre-whacked snakes? Beautiful.
Well, Marge, should I whack slow or fast? Slow, then fast.
- Uh-oh.
- Dad, please.
For the last time, I beg you.
Don't lower yourself to the level of the mob.
Lisa, maybe if I'm part of that mob, I can help steer it in wise directions.
Now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn? And now to open This year's festivities here's our grand marshal, the Prophet of Love, Larry White.
- Barry White.
- No.
It says here Larry White.
- I know my own name.
- Yeah? Well, we'll see.
Ladies and gentlemen, my unlimited love to y'all.
It's truly an honor to be here at this Hey, what is this all about anyway? Oh, God, no.
You people make me sick.
Were they even listening to me? I, uh, don't think so.
And now, let's hear it for our own Miss Springfield.
Gentlemen, start your whacking.
D'oh! Ew, a bug.
If the snakes were in here, we could protect them.
Well, according to this, snakes hear by sensing vibrations in the ground.
So, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass those snakes will be in here like Oprah on a baked ham.
Oh, good idea.
Let's see bass, bass.
Tiny Tim, The Chipmunks' Greatest Hits, A Castrato Christmas.
Mr.
White! Can we borrow you for a minute? Anything for a lady.
Don't bother the snakes.
Leave all the snakes alone.
Ah, yeah.
My baby.
- In here.
- #### Hey, where'd all the snakes go? People of Springfield, Whacking Day is a sham.
It was started in 1 924, as an excuse to beat up the Irish.
'Tis true.
I took many a lump.
But 'twas all in good fun.
Now, wait a minute! How can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you? I'm an old man.
I hate everything but Matlock.
Ooh, it's on now.
Mrs.
Glick, who killed all those rats in your basement? - A snake did.
- And you like snakes, don't you, Barry White? I love the sexy slither ofa lady snake.
Oh, baby.
Hooray for snakes! Hooray for snakes! Look at this everyone.
Twelve dead snakes.
I'm sick of you people.
You're nothing but a pack of fickle mush-heads.
- He's right.
- Give us hell, Quimby.
Bart, I'm very impressed at the independent learning you've displayed here.
- Thanks, Seymour.
- Ye Yes.
Um, anyway, as a reward for your studying I've decided to welcome you back to our school.
You'll be reunited with your chums, Nelson, Jimbo, D Oh, dear God! I guess I've always used violence as a way of getting attention.
Yes.
Yes.
Me too.
- Oh.
- Aw.
Faster, Willie, faster.
Now, we give 'em the bikes, no one sues.
What if they're dead, sir? Then we ride these bikes to Mexico and freedom, Willie! Freedom! Freedom.
I'll turn you in at the first tollbooth.

Until now, this was the only way to get juice from an orange.

You mean there's a better way? But that's all changed-- thanks to the Juice Loosener.
Let's meet the inventor, Dr.

Hello, Troy.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Dr.
Nick! Troy, would you like a glass of orange juice? I sure would.
But won't we have to pay those outrageous grocery-store prices for something the farmer probably spit in? Not anymore! All thanks to the new Juice Loosener.
[Applause.]
- [ Whirring Loudly.]
- Doctor, are you sure it's on? I can't hear a thing.
It's whisper quiet! You got all that from one bag of oranges? That's right.
Order now and you'll also get Sun 'n' Run the suntan lotion that's also a laxative.
Gotta get a juicer.
Gotta drink juice.
Lose weight.

I shall not leave the city-- - Hey, you, get that steel drum out of the, uh, mayor's office.
- Sorry, "mon.

I've constructed a germfree chamber for myself.

My name is Mr.

Come change the channel and pat my head.
- In a minute.
- But I'll miss Sheriff Lobo.
And get me a bottle of bourbon.
Grampa, you know you can't have liquids after 3:00 p.

You can stir it into my mush.

Mrs.
Simpson! You did not pay for this bottle of Colonel Kwik-E-Mart's Kentucky Bourbon.
Uh, no, I-- I guess I didn't.
- [Sirens Wailing.]
- [ Gasps .]
All right, come out with your hands up two cups of coffee an auto freshener that says Capricorn and something with coconut on it.
Now, Marge, you've come to the right place.
By hiring me as your lawyer, you also get this smoking monkey.
Better cut down there, Smokey.
- Mr.
Hutz-- - Look.
He's taking another puff!.
Mr.
Hutz, this was all a misunderstanding.
I didn't mean to take anything.
Now don't you worry, Mrs.
Simpson.
I-- - Uh-oh.
We've drawn Judge Snyder.
- Is that bad? Well, he's had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog.
- You did? - Well, replace the word "kinda" with the word "repeatedly" and the word "dog" with "son.
" - [ Groans .]
- Look, Marge.
I'll just talk to Apu and I'm sure he'll be reasonable.
[ Singing Indian Song .]
Apu, I'd like you to drop the charges against my wife.
No offense, but we're putting that bitch on ice.
Now come on! I'm your best customer.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Homer, but it is the policy of the Kwik-E-Mart and its parent corporation, Nordyne Defense Dynamics to prosecute shoplifters to the full extent of the law.
[ Singing .]
Don't tell anyone, but, uh, Marge Simpson was arrested for shoplifting.
Let the word go forth from this time and place Marge Simpson is a shoplifter.
- Hey! - In other news, the chick in The Crying Game - is really a man.
- [ All .]
Boo! - I mean, man, is that a good movie.
- [ All .]
Yea! And last Christmas, Marge made us gingerbread men.
And there was a hair in one.
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret about Marge Simpson.
She's got webbed toes.
- [ Laughing .]
- Ew, that's gross.
- Come on.
- Please.
Now, Marge, don't you worry.
We've all had our brushes with the law.
[Knocking.]
- Are you Ed Flanders? - No, Ned Flanders.
My mistake.
I'll never have that problem again.
Um, will you excuse me while I go and freshen up? I'll follow her.
Just wash your hands and get out.
[ Sighs .]
[Man.]
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury who do you find more attractive-- Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson? What is the point of all this? Your Honor, I feel so confident of Marge Simpson's guilt that I can waste the court's time by rating the super hunks.
- [ Impressed Murmuring .]
- Wow, that's confidence.
- Ooh, he's gonna win.
- Mr.
Hutz! Now, Mrs.
Lovejoy, could you tell us a little about Marge Simpson? Well, as the wife of the minister I'm privy to a lot of sensitive information.
And here it is.
Marge's husband doesn't earn much, and the family's a mess.
And, quite frankly, I think she, um-- [ Squeaking .]
Let the record show that the witness made the drinky-drinky motion.
And if we freeze on frame 1 38 we distinctly see a puff of blue hair coming from the grassy knoll.
Now, Apu, Mrs.
Simpson claims that she forgot she was carrying that bottle of delicious bourbon brownest of the brown liquors so tempting.
What's that? You want me to drink you? But I'm in the middle of a trial.
Excuse me.
- [ Line Ringing .]
- Hello, David.
I'm really tempted.
just take it one day at a time, and know that I love you.
I love you too, man.
So, Mr.
Nahasapeemapetilon, if that is your real name have you ever forgotten anything? No.
In fact, I can recite pi to 40,000 places.
The last digit is one.
Mmm, pie.
Well, if you never forget anything, tell me this.
What color tie am I wearing? You are wearing a red-and-white striped club tie in a half Windsor knot.
Oh, I am, am I? Is that what you think? Well, if that is what you think I have something to tell you.
[ Grunts .]
Something that may shock and discredit you.
And that thing is as follows.
I'm not wearing a tie at all.
- [ All Gasp .]
- [ Gasps .]
But if I am wrong about that maybe I am wrong about Mrs.
Simpson.
No further questions.
Kids, I got a crazy feeling your mom's not going to prison.
Yea! You're a latter-day Clarence Darrow.
Uh, was he the black guy on The Mod Squad? Mr.
Hutz, when I grow up, I wanna be a lawyer just like you.
Good for you, son.
If there's one thing America needs, it's more lawyers.
Can you imagine a world without lawyers? [Soft Rock.]
[ Shudders .]
And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I rest my case.
Hmm.
Mr.
Hutz, do you know you're not wearing any pants? What? [ Screams .]
I move for a bad court thingy.
- You mean a mistrial? - Yeah.
That's why you're the judge, and I'm the law-talkin' guy.
- The lawyer.
- Right.
[Judge Snyder.]
The foreman will pass the verdict to the bailiff.
This verdict is written on a cocktail napkin! - And it still says "guilty.
" And "guilty" is spelled wrong! - [ Squeaks .]
Will the foreman please read the real verdict? We find the defendant guilty.
Marge Simpson, I sentence you to 30 days in prison.
Next case.
The National Council of Churches vs.
Lionel Hutz.
- [ All Grumbling .]
- Oh, right.
That thing.
[ Crying .]
You're still my hero, Mom.
Now you kids be good while Mother's in prison.
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll bust you out of there just as soon as I get a cocktail dress and a crowbar.
[Mambo.]
Bartina, until I met you I was the loneliest warden in the penal system.
[ High-pitched .]
Fresh.
Oh, down I go.
I'll be fine, dear.
Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much.
And it's not just the sex.
It's also the food preparation.
Your skill with stains of all kinds.
But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning.
I'll miss you too, Homey.
With her behind bars, our store is secure.
I'm taking this thing to Mexico.
[Chuckling.]
Knock, knock.
I'm Marge Simpson, your new cell mate.
I'm Phillips.
They call me that 'cause I killed my husband with a Phillips head screwdriver.
[ Sighs .]
It's so nice not to have to cook.
- You mean your husband never cooked for you? - Well, once.
Homer, I don't think this fish is quite dead yet.
Marge, please, I'm having enough trouble with the lobsters.
[ Groaning .]
- Oh, my goodness! - That's Tattoo Annie.
[Marge.]
"What kind of slime would I marry?" - I don't understand.
- It's one of those Mad Magazine fold-ins.
Amazing! Now, kids, while your mother's gone I don't wanna have to wash any dishes.
So from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet.
- Who's gonna change Maggie? - We're gonna let her roam free in the backyard and nature will take its course.
Excuse me, but I think if we all do our fair share we can keep this house clean.
[ Screeches .]
[ Growling .]
Dad, we're running out of clean clothes.
It seems like I've been wearing this same red dress forever.
Go up to the attic.
There's a whole trunk of clothes up there.
[ Humming Wedding Song .]
All right! Bologna and cheese! What do you got, Bart? A pack of sugar and peanut butter smeared on a playing card.
Ha-ha! Your mom's a jailbird.
- So's yours.
- Oh, yeah.
Let's play.
[Footsteps.]
[Lisa.]
Oh, Mom, I've missed you so much.
Oh, honey, I've missed you too.
Homer, is that an old Halloween costume? Uh, no.
So, how are things at home? We flushed the gator down the toilet, but it got stuck halfway.
Now we have to feed it.
I'll bet you want a piece of me.
Well, you ain't gonna get it, see? [ Laughing .]
[Moans.]
Doggone it.
[Homer.]
Honey, I don't know what you're feelin' right now so I don't wanna push anything.
We can just hold hands or sit and talk.
- [ Growling .]
- Whoo! Oh, do you have any of those delicious marshmallow squares? Sorry.
Marge Simpson makes those.
- Oh, darn! - [ All Sigh .]
Fifteen dollars short.
Exactly what Marge Simpson's marshmallow squares bring in.
Can we still afford that statue of Lincoln? - No, I'm afraid we'll have to go with something cheaper.
- Ah.
I give you our 39th president, jimmy Carter.
- Oh, come on! - He's history's greatest monster! [ All Shouting .]
- Release the dogs.
- Gee, they look pretty mad.
Yeah, I've been starvin' 'em, teasin' 'em, singing off-key.
[ Singing Off-key.]
[ Screaming .]
No! Nice doggy.
This never would have happened if Marge Simpson was here.
Good-bye, Marge.
I'll miss ya.
I hope you find somebody.
Men are such slime.
But I'm seeing this new guy.
I think he's different.
Yoo-hoo! [ Belches .]
- He says his name is Homer, and he works at the nuclear plant.
- [ Groans .]
We gotta clean this up before Mom gets back.
No problemo.
We'll just sweep it all under the rug.
[Rumbling.]
[Objects Cracking.]
[Man.]
Hey, watch it.
[ Cheering .]
I didn't expect all this.
Well, we never should have let you go.
From now on, I'll use my gossip for good instead of evil.

We'd like to pay you two million dollars to do a camera commercial.
Whoa! Me rikey velly much! Oh, I hope I didn't offend you.

Bad enough to hit yourself over the head with the phone? - Oh! You got it! Ow! - [ Thumping .]
Ow! Ooh, blood.

What the-- [ Groans .]
If this is anyone but Steve Allen, you're stealing my bit.
Somebody ought to ruin Gabbo's career the way he ruined Krusty's.

- Yes, they do.
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.
- No, they don't.

- Hey, boyo, what's so funny? Well, it's-- Ah, you wouldn't be interested.
It's too lowbrow.
No, I'm quite lowbrow.
Well, somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall.
This I gotta see! All the kids in Springfield are S.

Thirty-five years in show business and already no one remembers me.
just like what's-his-name and who sits and, you know, that guy, always wore a shirt-- - Ed Sullivan? - Yeah.
I didn't know you knew Luke Perry! [ Scoffs .]
Know him? He's my worthless half-brother.
- He's a big TV star.
- Yeah, on Fox.
Elizabeth Taylor.
Bette Midler.
Bette and I owned a racehorse together: Krudler.
Hey, Bart, if we get all these big stars to appear on a special with Krusty it might get his career going again.
Here's my address book.
Go get those stars! It won't be easy, but I'm gonna claw my way back on to TV.
[ Singing .]
[Male Announcer.]
And now, the Crazy Old Man Singers.
[Male Chorus Singing.]
Miss Midler, I can't believe you do this all by yourself.
We're Americans.
We deserve clean highways.

Oh, no! Bette Midler! [ Grunting .]
[ Yelling .]
[Crash.]
Now, where were we? We were asking you to appear on Krusty's Komeback Special.
Okay.

And off to your left is Hugh Hefner's Shelbyville pad.
- A lot of people know about the grotto and the game room.
- Of course.
But few know about the laboratory, the biosphere the alternative energy research center.
Fascinating.
- Desalinization plant? - Yes.
The grotto uses so much water, the Bunnies felt we should go this way.
- Smart Bunnies, Hef.
I can call you Hef, can't I? - No.
You told our agent this place holds 30,000 people.
It does.
We had 30,000 here last night.
Now play.
The audience is gettin' restless.
We want Chilly Willy! We want Chilly Willy! Hey, Red Hot Chili Peppers would you guys like to appear on a Krusty the Clown special? - Sure, if you can get us out of this gig.
- No problemo.
- Hey, Moe, look over there.
- What? What am I lookin' at? I don't see nothin'.
I'm gonna stop looking soon.
- What? What, is that it? - Hey, Moe, can I look too? - Sure, but it'll cost ya.
- My wallet's in the car.
He is so stupid.
And now, back to the wall.
[ Humming .]
Miss Taylor, a couple of grade-school kids Wanted you to be on a Krusty special.
- I told them to buzz off.
- Good.
[ Humming .]
- [Pounding On Door.]
- Krusty, we've got great news! [ Both Screaming .]
[ Groaning .]
Krusty, what have you done to yourself? I thought I'd get into shape, so I've been drinking nothing but milk shakes.
- You mean those diet milk shakes? - Uh-oh.
Now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight.
You can sleep on the sofa.
It folds right out.
[ Grunting, Yelling .]
Oh, wait.
That was the old sofa.
[ Screeching .]
Oh, I'll never get my aim back.
- You gotta keep working on it.
- Oh! Aah! Aah! Water! [ Yelling .]
Mmm, delicious.
- Oh, why am I bothering? It's hopeless.
- [ Gabbo On TV.]
Hi, kids.
It's me, Gabbo! [ Laughing .]
Pork prices rose in early trading today.
But you've gotta comeback, Mel! - We're a team.
- No, Krusty.
You always treated me rather shabbily.
On our last show, you poured liquid nitrogen down my pants and cracked my buttocks with a hammer.
Ah, come on.
You wanna waste your life hanging out with a bunch of dorky teenagers? Here's your taco, mister.
Oops.
It fell in the fryer.
I'll get it out.
Ow! Ow! Ow!Ow! Sorry, Krusty.
I like it here.
Mr.
Johannson treats me with dignity.
Is this clown bothering you, Mel? That's all right, Mr.
Johannson.
I'll handle it.
- Here's your taco, sir.
- I don't want it.
But this comes out of my salary.
If I had a girlfriend, she'd kill me.
[Man.]
Okay, Krusty, let's rehearse the balloon bit.
Look, kids! A horsie! And what are you making, Sideshow Luke Perry? A 1 9th-century carousel.
[Yells.]
Upstage me, will ya? - Get the hell out! - Look, there must be something I can do on the show.
Please.
For Mom's sake? Well, maybe we can find something.
[ Yelling .]
[ Sinister Chuckling .]
I don't like it.
He's got Johnny Carson, Bette Midler and Hugh Hefner.
- What've we got? - Ray Jay Johnson.
Oy.
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi! Now, boys the network has a problem with some of your lyrics.
- Would you mind changing 'em for the show? - For get you, clown.
Hey, our lyrics are like our children, man.
No way.
Well, okay.
But here, where you say "What I got, you gotta get and put it in you," how about just, "What I'd like is I'd like to hug and kiss you"? - Wow! That's much better.
- Everyone can enjoy that.

Oy! - What's up, Moe? - Hey, Moe! Hey, you can't come in here dressed like that! - Get with the times, Moe.
- Yeah.
I say if it feels good, do it.
All right.
- [ Chuckling .]
- Don't snap my undies.
I'm a star again.
I don't know how to thank you, kids.
- That's all right, Krusty.
- We're getting 50%% of the T-shirt sales.
What? That's the sweetest plum! You little-- Aw, what the hell.
You deserve it.
Thanks, kids.

It's Dad! Dad, when did you record an album? I'm surprised you don't remember, son.
It was only eight years ago.

No, really.
I can't.
It's a serious problem.
[ Laughing .]
[ Laughing .]
What are we all laughing about? - [ Laughing .]
- Who cares? Anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1 985.
A maturing Joe Piscopo left Saturday Night Live to conquer Hollywood.
People Express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel.
And I was in a barbershop quartet.
" [ Pitch Pipe Hums .]
[ Harmonizing .]
" Hello " " Hello, my baby Hello, my honey " " Hello, my ragtime ragtime gal " [ Homer's Voice .]
Every afternoon at Moe's, Chief Wiggum Principal Skinner, Apu and I would get together and sing.
And the crowds went wild.
- Yoo-hoo! - " Then you'll be left alone " Barbershop? That ain't been popular since aught-six, dag-nab it! What did I tell you? No talking like a grizzled 1 890s prospector.
Consarn it.
Anyway, rock and roll had become stagnant.
''Achy Breaky Heart'' was seven years away.
Something had to fill the void.
And that something was barbershop.
[ Harmonizing .]
" Good-bye " " Good-bye my Coney Island baby " That's my son up there! - What, the balding fat-ass? - Uh, no, the Hindu guy.

Homer, I'm a theatrical agent.
I want to represent your group.
- Really? - Yeah, you've got it.
All except that police officer.
Yuck! Too Village People.
You'll have to replace him.
Just leave it to me.
[ Panting .]

- Run along, boy.
You're free now.

- Eh, never fit on a marquis, luv.
From now on your name is Apu de BeaumarchÃ©.
It is a great dishonor to my ancestors and my god, but okay.
[ Homer's Voice .]
The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement.
" Old MacDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O " "And on this farm he had a chick " "The swingingest chick I know " "With a wiggle-wiggle here And a wiggle-wiggle there " - Get off the stage! - I want to, but I can't.

Boy! We sounded great, huh? Only one question remains, gentlemen.
What do we call ourselves? How about Handsome Homer Simpson, Plus Three? I like it! - [ Stammering .]
- I do not-- I do not think-- No.
We need a name that's witty at first but seems less funny each time you hear it.
How about the Be Sharps? Perfect.

[ Chuckles .]

I haven't seen a bong in years.
No one bought a wishbone necklace.
One of us made some money.
I sold a guy our spare tire.
- [ Tire Blows .]
- D'oh! Well, it'll be a long time before your mother gets back with the tire so why don't I tell you more of the story? Now that we had a name, the Be Sharps needed a hit.
Something new, something exciting, something mid-1 980s.
"There was nothing in Al Capone's vault " " But it wasn't Geraldo's fault " D'oh! [ Grunts .]

- Oh, yes! - Yes! Wait till I tell Marge! Oh, yes.
Bouffant Betty.
Well, I would prefer we kept your marriage a secret.
A lot of women are going to want to have sex with you and, uh, we want them to think they can.
Well, if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand.

Oh, Home-- [ Groaning .]

[ Women Screaming .]
I have a question for Apu de BeaumarchÃ©.
Isn't it true that you're really an Indian? By the many arms of Vishnu, I swear it is a lie.
Barney, how did you join the group? They found me on the men's room floor.
- Principal Skinner-- - Mm-hmm? You've been referred to as ''the funny one.
'' - Is that reputation justified? - Yes.
Yes, it is.
" Good-bye, my Coney Isle-- Good-bye, my Coney Isle-- " " Good-bye my Coney Island babe " " Good-bye my Coney Island babe " Damned ceremonies.
This is time I could be working, Mommy.
We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman.
She's 1 00 years old, and she weighs over 200 tons.

Okay.

- Hi-oh.

Yea! Congratulations! David Crosby, you're my hero! - Oh, you like my music? - You're a musician? [ Homer's Voice .]
Then came the greatest thrill of my life.
Hello, Homer.
I'm George Harrison.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Where did you get that brownie? - There's a big pile of'em.
[ Squealing .]
Oh, man.
What a nice fellow.
Lisa, did you see the Grammys? You beat Dexy's Midnight Runners.
You haven't heard the last of them.
- I miss you, Daddy.

Oh, thanks.

- Wow! An award statue! Oh, it's a Grammy.

- [ Man .]
Hey, don't throw your garbage down here.
! - [ Clank .]
- [ Thud .]
Wow, look at all this Be Sharps merchandise! Lunch boxes, coffee mugs funny foam.
They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous.
But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die.
- Bart! - What? I can't believe you're not still popular.
What'd you do? Screw up like the Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus? All the time.
It was the title of our second album.
But we were about to learn an iron law of show business.
What goes up must come down.
What about Bob Hope? He's been consistently popular for over 50 years.
- So has Sinatra.
- Well, anyway, we were all getting tired of-- Dean Martin still packs 'em in.
- Ditto Tom Jones.
- Shut up! With your father on the road all the time, I tried to compensate for his absence.
[ Homer's Voice .]

I pity the fool who doesn't like he.
- And where's Barney? - Oh, he's with his new girlfriend theJapanese conceptual artist.

Then came the day we knew we were finished.
Gentlemen, Us magazine just came out with its what's hot and what's not issue.
- Are we hot? - We are not.
[ Homer's Voice .]
We all went our separate ways.
Well, William, I'm back.
So, how did you spend your summer? I made millions in software and lost it at the track.
Ach! It may not be glamorous, but it's good, honest work.
- How much is this quart of milk? - Twelve dollars.
- Hey, Barney, what'll it be? - I'd like a beer, Moe.
I'd like a single plum floating in perfume, served in a man's hat.
Here you go.
Hey, fellas.
I'm back.
Oh, that's great.
Your replacement is getting tired.
[ Clucks .]
- Hey, Queenie, you can go now.
- I'll give her a good home.
And I did.
I'll never forget my five and a half weeks at the top.
-Man, that's some story.
-There are still a few things I don't get.
Like, how come we never heard about this until today? - What happened to the money? - Why haven't you hung up your gold record? - Since when could you write a song? - [ Laughs .]
There are perfectly good answers to those questions but they'll have to wait for another night.
Now off to bed.
[ Creaks .]
I can't remember the last time we were all together.
Last year, on that stupid Dame Edna special.
And a one, and a two, and a three-- " Ba-bum-bum-bum " " Baby on board " " How I've adored " " That sign on my car's windowpane " Hello! Human Fly here.
Come on! I stayed up all night dyeing my underwear.

There's nothing in here about the Be Sharps! - Come back here! - Ha-ha.

- I'm pretty sure there is.
- Ha! The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle-- - Uh, hey, she's right, Chief.

It's also illegal to put squirrels down your pants for the purposes of gambling.

Who's someone you've been making irritating phone calls to for years? - Linda Lavin? - No, someone who didn't deserve it.

- Hello, Moe? We know you're the one behind this, so knock it off, or we're going to the cops! No, no, I'll take care of it.
Okay, it's over.

- You awful man! - Stay away from my son.
- Oh, I'll stay away from your son, all right.
Stay away forever.
- Oh, no! - Wait a minute.
That's no good.

And once a man is in your home, anything you do to him - is nice and legal.
- Is that so? Oh, Flanders, won't you join me in my kitchen? - [ Door Opens .]

It's time for your bribe.
Now, you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing or you can trade it all in for what's in this box.
The box.
The box! Burns, this is a big problem.
You just can't throw money at it and make it go away.
Gentlemen, I've decided there will be no investigation.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go away.
You're in big trouble, Burns.
Simpson's job requires college training in nuclear physics.
You get your man up to speed, or we'll be forced to take legal action.
Is that so? Well, I have the feeling you'll be dropping the charges.
- The painters moved your desk, sir.
- Oh, yes.
[ Doorbell Rings .]
Hello, Simpson.
My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and thought we'd stop by.
Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares? - [ All Murmuring .]
- Yes, he would.
- So you want me to go to college? - College? - Ha! Barber or clown? - Bart! Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 1 01 .
Oh, and one more thing.
You must find the jade monkey before the next full moon.
Actually, sir, we found the jade monkey.
It was in your glove compartment.
- And the road maps and ice scraper? - They were in there too, sir.
Excellent! It's all falling into place.
I think this is a great opportunity.
You could learn so much.
Maybe you're right.
I did always want to go to college.
But fate stood in the way.
Homer, sign this application and you're a shoo-in.

No.
- Katherine Hepburn's Me? - No! Ohh! I suck! It was the most I ever threw up, and it changed my life forever.
You the man, Homer! Thanks, boy.
Now for the crowning touch.
I don't know, Dad.
Don't you have a better picture? Relax.
A photo can't make any difference.

- You don't know, do you? - No, ma'am.
Don't worry, Simpson.
It just so happens I have a chair at Springfield University.

I'm sorry, Mr.

- This Simpson is not qualified.

As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time.

Hi there.
Hello.
I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby.

Ah, did you see that jerk? [ Laughing Continues .]
Dropped his notes! [ Laughing More Loudly .]

Then kiss my curvy butt good-bye.

Whoo-hoo! " [ Rock .]
Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.
Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus.
Besides, it isn't costing us.
I swiped the cinder blocks from a construction site.
Sir, six cinder blocks are missing.
There'll be no hospital then.
I'll tell the children.
This proton accelerator destabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it-- Uh, excuse me, Professor Brainiac but I worked in a nuclear power plant for 1 0 years and, uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works.
- Well, please come down and show us.
- All right.
I will.
[ Screaming .]
- In there, guys.
- [ Both .]
Thanks, Homer.
Homer, no one blames you for the accident.
We simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring.

Yeah, you won this round, Dean but the war isn't over.

You're hangin' with nerds.
- You take that back! - Homer, please.
These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds.
Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
Dad, nerds are nothing to fear.
In fact, they've done some pretty memorable things.
Some nerds of note include popcorn magnate Orville Redenbacher rock star David Byrne and Supreme CourtJustice David Souter.
[ Gasps .]
Oh, not Souter! Oh, no! Come on, Mr.

You'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table.

- Oh! Including all known lanthanides and actinides? - [ Chuckling .]
Good luck.

Come on, guys.
Look at yourselves! All you do is study.
I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college.
We're gonna go out and par-ty! Wait a minute.
I'll put on my snow pants.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Ah, the college road trip.
What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem? If you're going for a ride, I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
But, Marge, we're college guys, and we're up to no good.
Mr.
Simpson, Gary spilled his ear medicine.
Oh, those baby ducks were so cute.
I can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them.
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- We stopped five minutes ago.
Someone knocked on the door, and I couldn't go.
I'm telling you.
A big, crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered.
[ Giggling .]
The dean will go nuts.
I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge! -[ Scraping Sound .]
- [ All Groaning .]
So it's a prank you're looking for, is it? I'll give you your prank.
The only other college in 50 miles is Springfield A&M so they're our best target.
- Those bastards.
- Meet Sir Oinkcelot the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M.
Here he is presiding over last year's homecoming.
Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon.
And here he is rolling in his own filth.
Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinkcelot.
And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge! [ Laughing .]

Of course he does.
He's a cute little piggy.

- He and Mr.

Hello! That sounds like a pig fainting.

I'm sorry, boys.
I-I've never expelled anyone before, but that pig had some powerful friends.
Oh, you'll pay.
Don't think you won't pay! Guys, believe me.
I didn't mean to get you expelled.
Don't worry, Mr.
Simpson.
We can take care of ourselves.
Ah, wallet inspector.
Oh, here you go.
I believe that's all in order.
I can't believe that worked! Hey! That's not the wallet inspector.

It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher.
Can't we do something? Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony.
- Right, Marge? - No, I want those geeks out of my house.
You really think you can get us back into college? Absolutely.
Now, the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme! Why does it have to be zany? [ Gasps .]
I've got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.

- Perfect.

We push him out of the way in exactly three seconds.
Should we correct for wind resistance? Hmm, possibly.
What do you think? -[ Thudding .]
- Oh, my.
Well, Dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank.
- Prank? - And all those other pranks were my idea too.
I'm the one who should be expelled.
Well, I'm touched by your honesty.
And who knows-- Perhaps I've been a bit of an ogre myself.
- Yes, you have.
- How's this? I'll readmit your friends and we'll forget this whole silly incident ever occurred.
Oh, Dean.
This is what your new hip is going to look like.

Simpson.
Ah, no problem, guys.
The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends.
So, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam.
Exam? Oh! This is just like one of those bad dreams! [ Screams .]
What are you gonna do, Mr.
Simpson? Actually, I've been working on a plan.
During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out.
Or with our help, you can cram like you've never crammed before! Whatever.
Either way is good.
Whoo-hoo! Oh, man.
I can't believe you failed.
Oh, I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified! Mr.
Simpson, there is a way.
We could, well, use a computer to change your grade.
[ Gasps .]
Computers can do that? Oh, yes.
The only problem is the moral dilemma it raises, which requires-- [ Kissing .]
Oh, I love-- Moral whuzzah? An A-plus! How did you do it? Oh, let's just say I had help from a little magic box.
- You changed your grade with a computer? - D'oh! Way to go, Dad! The important thing is that we all learned a lesson.
These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college.
- No, we didn't.
- Oh.
Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
No, you didn't.
You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong.
Hmm.
True.
And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son you're gonna take that course over again without cheating.
Oh, Marge! You're worse than that crusty old dean.
[ Sighs .]
Well, I guess it's back to college for me.
That means it's time to-- What did I teach you guys? [ Nerds .]
Par-ty down? Yes! "[ Rock .]
- [ People Chattering .]
- Shh!

"Tra la la la la la Tra la la la la " I am the happiest boy there is.
Aren't I, Bobo? Mmm! - Happy! Come here, Happy! - Yes, Mumsy? Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving, natural parents or would you rather live with this twisted, loveless billionaire? Let's roll.
Wait! You forgot your bear-- a symbol of your lost youth and innocence! [ Sighs .]
Oh, well.
At least we still have his little brother, George.
" Ba ba ba bum Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home " " Ba ba ba bum " Trust me.
It'll be funny when I'm an old man.
[ Muttering .]
I want my teddy.
Ah, Bobo.
Bobo.
Ah! Oh, it's you.
- The bedpan's under my pillow.
- Who's Bobo, sir? Bobo? [ Stammering .]
I, uh, meant Lobo.
Uh, Sheriff Lobo.
They never should have canceled that show.
I see.
On another topic, the preparations for your birthday have begun.
- I won't get what I really want.
- No one does.
" [ Singing .]
Mmm.
Lobo.
Lobo.
Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo! [ Screams .]
- What, Homie? - Oh, no! Burns's birthday! - What's wrong? - Every time Mr.
Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party and I always get some terrible job.
Where is that dreaded pinata? Ow! Ow! Ow! Missed me.
Heh-heh! Ow! Hmm! - [ Laughter .]
- [ Grunting .]
Not funny.
And the one in my pants really hurts.
That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers-- Who is he? Homer Simpson, sir, one of the carbon blobs from Sector 7G.
- But I don't think that-- - I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party.
I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
Fine, sir.
I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esque material.
[ Laughing .]
- I'm so funny.
This is gonna be great.
- What are you doing? I'm writing a delicious send-up of Mr.
Burns for his birthday party.
- Is ''poo poo'' one word or two? [ Laughs .]
- [ Laughs .]
I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr.
Burns's foibles, if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.
Well, I also do a delightful impression of him.
[ Chuckling .]
I paint a frowny face on my butt and pull down my pants! [ Both Laughing .]
Yeah! [ Both Groaning .]
Now, I'm not saying Mr.
Burns is incontinent-- - [ Laughing.]
Incontinent! - [ Laughing .]
- Too rich.
- Does either of you know what ''incontinent'' means? - Lisa, don't spoil our fun.
- Come on, dear.
It's time to go.
Okay, stupid! Homer, you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss.
Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition.
It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters.
Hey, Flanders! You smell like manure! Uh-oh.
Better cancel that dinner party tonight.
Thanks for the nose news, neighbor! [ All Grumbling .]
- Hey! No one-termers.
- Ah! You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place.
Get away from me, loser.
[ Smithers On P.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you ''Montgomery Burns-- - A Life.
'' - [ Applause .]
- Oh, Bobo.
- Hmm.
- [ Applause .]
- Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far.
- Ladies and gentlemen, the Ramones.
- [ Applause .]
Ah, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves.
- I'd just like to say this gig sucks! - Hey, up yours, Springfield! One, two, three, four! - " Happy birthday to you " - " Happy birthday " - " Happy birthday to you " - " Happy birthday " " Happy birthday, Burnsie " " Happy birthday to you " - [ Applause .]
- Go to hell, you old bastard.
Hey, I think they liked us.

- Oh, sir, those aren't-- - Do as I say! [ Burns Scoffs .]
Stinks.
Piffle.
DustBuster? Yech! - [ Groans .]
- Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles.
There's a satellite hookup on that monitor.
If you'll just turn your head slightly-- Bah! No time.
Next! I have some sad news to report.
A small puppy, not unlike Lassie, was just run over in the parking lot.
- [ All Gasp .]
- Now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson! - Are you ready to laugh? - Oh, that poor dog.
I said, ''Are you ready to laugh?'' Quiet, you awful man.
- You know, Mr.
Burns is so cheap-- - What? I ju-- I mean, you know, Mr.
Burns is so old-- - How dare you! - Whoo-hoo.
Tough crowd.
Better bring out the big guns.
[ Clears Throat .]
Here's an impression of Mr.
Burns that you might find a little cheeky.
- [ All Gasp .]
- I'm Mr.
Burns.
Blah, blah, blah.
Do this, do that.
Blah, blah, blah.
I think I'm so big.
Blah, blah, blah.
! - Destroy him.
- Blah, blah, blah.
Look at me-- Ow! This party is over.
[ Guests Screaming .]
Oww.
! Where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.
I'd like to believe that this time.
I really would.
Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father.
Yes'm.
Dad, I know you're discouraged - but, please, don't deny the world your fat can.
- Don't worry, boy.
- [ Patting .]
- She'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.
- I knew it.
- [ Burns Groans .]
- I knew it.
- [ Burns Groans .]
Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr.
Burns: King Arthur's Excalibur; the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain; and that rare first draft of the Constitution with the word ''suckers'' in it.
- Yes, yes, yes.
So what? - You want your bear, Bobo, don't you? Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! [ Groaning .]
Resistance is futile.
[ Grunts, Sighs .]
Oh, God, how I want my bear.
But he's gone-- gone forever.
I'd give anything to know what happened to him.
Why, put some grease in your garter, Lindy! You're late! [ Crowd Cheering .]
- [ Bomb Whistles, Explodes .]
- [ Groans .]
This is all your fault! [ Grunts .]
[ Men Grunting .]
You gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag.
We lost four more men on this expedition.
If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it.
- Yeah.
He's got us there.
- Beats me.
Hey, Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it.
Ooh, a head bag! Those are chock-full of heady goodness.
Hey, it's a teddy bear! [ Sniffing .]
Ew, gross.
It's probably diseased or something.
Here, Maggie.
"[ Dramatic Chord, Needle Scratches Record .]

[ Smithers .]
Here's something that should cheer you up, sir.
It's me, sir-- Bobo.
Hug me.
Squeeze me.
Tug at my fur.
[ Growls .]
Enough! Stop this grotesque charade.
Now, find my teddy.
Oh, and, uh, leave the costume.
The Burns bear, perhaps the most valuable ''wittle'' bear in the world, could be anywhere.
It could be in your house.
You could be looking at it right now.
It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth - perhaps being held up by a loved one.
- Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV.
Put that moldy, old bear down.
Moldy? Old? I'm gonna get something to eat! Well, it's not your original bear, of course, hey.
- But it is programmed to be just as cuddly.
Ah, doggone it.
- [ Beeping .]
- [ Mechanical Growl .]
- It's supposed to be doing a little dance.
- Heh.
! - Eh! Ooh! Get the bear off!.
- I got him.
[ Grunts .]
- Tryin' to turn it off.
No.
Bear want to live.

"[ Choir Vocalizing .]
Uh! Huh! Uh! [ Panicked Yelling, Shouting .]
D'oh! Son of a-- You stupid stair! Uh! Ooh! [ Gasps .]
How long have we had these fish? Wait.
The bear-- Burns's bear.
''Bobo.
'' It's Mr.
Burns's bear all right.
Well, Burns isn't getting this back cheap.
I can tell you that.
He's gonna have to give me my own recording studio.
"Two all-beef patties special sauce, lettuce, cheese " " Pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun " [ Moaning .]
[ Man Over Speakers .]
Homer,you're drooling on the mike again.
I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
[ Both Laughing .]
Hmm.
Better sew that eye back on.
No! Let's send Burns the eye in the mail.
- He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear's in danger.
- Yes, we'll send the eye.
I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward, and then we'll make him double it.
- Huh? - Hmm? Well, why can't I be greedy once in a while? Bobo.
My beautiful Bobo.
- I promise I'll never leave you behind again.
- [ Clears Throat .]
Ah, yes.
Naturally, I can't pay you much of a reward, because I'm strapped for cash.
[ Creaking .]
Ooh! Uh! As you can see, this old place is falling apart.
- But I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
- Yes, sir.
[ Thinking .]
Reject the first offer.
Reject the first offer.
- May I offer you a drink? - Sorry, Burns.
No deal! [ Grunts .]
Ah, don't worry, Smithers.
He's playing hardball now but it won't take him long to crack.
[ Cracking Sound .]
Whoo-hoo! I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns! Maybe I can still get that drink.
Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay.
Right.
That makes sense.
- [ Yelps .]
No! No! Let me go! - [ Family Shouting, Grunting .]
I knew you'd come crawling back.
- How much do you want? - A million dollars and three Hawaiian islands-- - good ones, not the leper ones.
- Done! Now give me that bear! Whoo-hoo! I'm rich! Rich, I tells ya! Here ya go.
[ Grunting .]
It seems to be stuck.
Bad baby! Bad Maggie! [ Whimpering .]
Give me the bear.
The bear.
The bear! [ Exasperated Sigh .]
Here you go, Maggie.
The deal's off, Mr.
Burns.
The bear stays here.
- You've made a mistake, Simpson.
- [ Growling .]
Aw, big deal.
Who needs his money? - We're gettin' by okay.
- [ Crashing .]
Son! You gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here and I don't have any insurance! So, how's by you? [ Clicking .]
Excellent shot, Smithers.
I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time.
Howdy, gents.
What can I didilly-do ya for? [ Moaning .]

- Aw, no fair.
- [ Whip Cracks .]
- Ow.
! - Hmm.
I wonder what makes it turn.
- Who cares? Maggie, I know you like the bear but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with this box! See, Maggie? See the fun box? " Do do do do do do Do do do do " [ Giggling .]
No! My box! My box! [ Giggling .]
[ Groans .]
I think we need a new hair dryer.
Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr.
Burns's money.
I don't hate you.
I'm proud of you.
You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.
Oh, thanks, Marge.
But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul.

- Holy crap! - [ Gasps .]
- What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer? - That's right.
- Wrong.

- Never mind! - Let's just get him! - Yeah! - Uh! - Smithers, I'm home! - [ Canned Laughter.]
- What? Already? - [ Canned Laughter.]
- Yes.

- Come on! Let's go in there and get the bear! - [ All Shouting .]

- Hah! I got it.
- [ Cheering .]
Ah, geez.
Will you look at that? - [ Moans Softly .]
- Hmm? - What have we become? - We've given the word ''mob'' a bad name.

- Well, what should we do now? - Hey, everybody, let's go sing at the hospital.

- Simpson, look what you've reduced me to.
- [ Snaps Fingers .]
Please! Please! But, Mr.
Burns, it's not my bear.
- It's Maggie's.
- Eh.
So, good sand today, hmm? Heh! Oh, well.
I don't usually, eh-- Well,just this once.
Eww! Damn you paparazzo! Uh! Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought.
I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement.

What could be more humiliating? - What a scoop! - Okay, Maggie.

But I want you to do something for me.

Don't make the same mistake I made.

[ Sucking Sounds .]
For me? Bobo? Ahh! Smithers, I'm so happy.
Something amazing has happened.
I'm actually happy! Take a note: From now on I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone! I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have a pencil.
Ah, don't worry.
I'm sure I'll remember it.
Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr.
Burns got what he wanted.
Marge, I'm confused.
Is this a happy ending or a sad ending? It's an ending.
That's enough.
And there you go.
Ah, Bobo.
Reunited at last.
But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you.

Oh! And now to make the leap from dreams to reality.
Sorry, Homer.
While you were daydreaming, we ate all the doughnuts.
Well, there were a few left, but we chucked 'em at an old man for kicks.
Damn buzzards! I ain't dead yet! All right.
Stay calm.
Remember your training.

Just sign here.

Who's that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jib.
Uh, Prince of Darkness, sir.
He's your 1 1 :00.

Ah! Now, remember, the instant you finish it, I own your soul for-- Hey, wait, if I don't finish this last bite you don't get my soul, do you? - Uh, technically no, but--- - I'm smarter than the devil! I'm smarter than the dev-- You are not smarter than me! I'll see you in hell yet, Homer Simpson! Not likely.

Hm.
Hm.
Hm.
Mmm! Mmm! Forbidden doughnut.
- Hmm? - Well, well.
Finishing something? [ Screams .]

- Homer, did you eat that doughnut? - No.
Your wide behind won't save you this time.
Hey, Bart.
- Hey.
- Wait! Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial? Oh, you Americans with your ''due process'' and ''fair trials.
'' This is always so much easier in Mexico.
All right.
Very well.
We'll have the trial tomorrow at the stroke of midnight.
Till then, you're going to spend the day in hell! [ Screaming .]
[ Sighs .]
That wasn't so bad.
Huh? Ow! Ow! Ow! So, you like doughnuts, eh? - Uh-huh.
- Well have all the doughnuts in the world! [ Cackling .]
More.
Mmm! I don't understand it.

Agreed.
Number two: The jury will be chosen by me.

I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson pledging me his soul for a doughnut! Which I delivered! And it was scrum-didilly-umptious.
I simply ask for what is mine.
- [ Murmuring .]
- That was a right pretty speech, sir.
But I ask you, what is a contract? Webster's defines it as ''an agreement under the law which is unbreakable.
'' ''Which is unbreakable''! Excuse me.

That's a photo of Homer and me at our wedding.
Wait a minute.
You got married in an emergency room? Well, Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself before the wedding.

- Yea! - Whoo-hoo-- Ow! All right, Simpson.
You get your soul back.
But let that ill-gotten doughnut be forever on your head.

- Homer, stop picking at it.
- Oh! But I'm so sweet and tasty.

Well, time to go to work.

Bart, what's wrong? I just had a vision of my own horrible, fiery death.
- And? - Lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare.
- Don't worry, honey.
The scary part's over.
- [ Horn Blaring .]
Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina! - It was just sitting in some guy's boat.
- [ Horn Blaring .]
Hello, Simpson.
I'm riding the bus because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone.
- She was right to do it.
- Excuse me.

Hey, where's your diaper, baby? Thank goodness he's drawn attention away from my shirt.

- Quick, look out the window.
- No way, Bart.
If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies, wet willies or even the dreaded rear admiral.
Otto, you gotta do something! There's a gremlin on the side of the bus! Hey, no problemo, Bart-dude.
I'll get rid of it.
No! Oh, no.
I just made my last payment.
Oh.
[ Screams .]
Everybody! There's a monster on the side of the bus! [ Yelling .]
Hey, there's no monster.
- You're deceptive.

You believe me, don't you? You're my friend who believes me.
Sweet, trustworthy Milhouse.
Actually, Bart, you're kinda creepin' me out.
Uh, I think I'm gonna go sit, uh w-with that foreign exchange student.
Oh, guten Tag.
! Would you care for a bite of my Vengelerstrasse bar? I also have a bag of marzipan JoyJoys! The gremlin's takin' off the wheel! Stop the bus or we're all gonna die! Aaah! Take me bridle and lash his hands to the seat! Would you like another lick of my flavor wax? Uh, sure.

Aw, isn't that cute? He's trying to claw my eyes out.
Whoa! Gadzooks! Look at the bus! I was right, I tell ya! I was right! Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man.
Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse - will teach you some manners.
- Ha-ha! [ Sighs .]
At least now I can get some rest.
Hidilly-ho, Bart! We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening.
To even gaze upon it is to go mad.
[ Shrieks .]
They're dogs, and they're playing poker! Aaah! [ Crazed Laughter.]
We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense.
So we just threw something together with vampires.
Enjoy! [ Kent Brockman On TV.]
Another local peasant has been found dead drained of his blood, with two teeth marks on his throat.
This black cape was found on the scene.
Police are baffled.
We think we're dealing with a supernatural being most likely a mummy.
As a precaution, I've ordered the Egyptian wing of the Springfield Museum destroyed.
Nice work, Ed.
No, no, they're wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead.
Nosferatu.
Das Vampyr.
A vampire! [ Chuckles .]
Lisa, vampires are make-believe.
Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos.
In a completely unrelated story, Montgomery Burns has just closed a deal to buy the Springfield Blood Bank.
Oh, I'm very excited about this deal.
What? Oh.
Precious blood.
Hmm.
Business deal.
It sure was nice of Mr.
Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in Pennsylvania.
Ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup.
Lisa, stop being so suspicious.
Did everyone wash their necks like Mr.
Burns asked? - Yes.
- Sure did.
- [ Doorbell Chimes .]
- [ Mr.
Burns Over Speaker.]
Welcome.
Come in.
Ah, fresh victims for my ever-growing army of the undead.
- [ Smithers .]
Sir, you have to let go of the button.
- Oh, son of a bit-- Well, if it isn't my good friends, the, uh-- - Simpson family, master.
- Simpson, eh? Excellent.
Dad, do you notice anything strange? Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.
- I heard that! - It was the boy! [ Gasps .]
Ooh! Punch! Eww.
Dad, this is blood.
Correction-- free blood.
Whoops.
Bart and I have to go wash up.
But you didn't get any on me-- Ugh-- Wh-- Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire.
And even if he was, we're not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place.
You're probably right.
Let's just go back.
[ Gasps .]
- Satisfied? - Big deal.
It's no different from the basement in Grampa's rest home.
Look! [ Gasps .]
Oh, my God! - [ Muttering .]
- Please, Bart.
I've seen your stupid Shemp.
Nyung, nyung, nyung, nyung! Yeah, I've seen your Curly too.
- [ Growls .]
- [ Screams .]
I know I really shouldn't, but when am I gonna be here again? Whee! - [ Growling .]
- [ Screaming .]
Well, if it isn't little-- uh, boy.
Mom, Dad! Mr.
Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart! [ Mr.
Burns .]
Why, Bart is right here.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.
I missed you during my uneventful absence.
Oh, Lisa, you and your stories.
''Bart is a vampire.
'' ''Beer kills brain cells.
'' Now, let's go back to that building thingy where our beds and TV is.
[ Screaming .]
Come join us, Lisa.
It's so cool.
You get to stay up all night drinking blood.
And if you say you're a vampire you get a free small soda at the movies.
No! No! Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here.
Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist-- [ Gasps .]
Wait a minute! You are a vampire! Quick! We have to kill the boy! How'd you know he's a vampire? He's a vampire? Aaah! [ Cackling .]
Homer, we gotta do something.
Today, he's drinking people's blood.
Tomorrow, he could be smoking.
The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire Mr.
Burns.
Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American dream? This is dangerous.
I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie.
[ Gasps .]
Super fun happy slide! - No, Dad.
- Oh! I guess killing will be fun enough.
You must drive this stake right through his heart.
Take that, vile fiend! Uh, Dad, that's his crotch.
[ Laughs .]
Oh, sorry.
[ Screaming .]
No! [ Groaning .]
- You're fired! - D'oh! It's so nice having everything back to normal.
I'm a vampire, and I've come to suck your blood.
Blah! Oh-- This cape is giving me a rash.
- Grampa's a vampire? - We're all vampires.
But, no, we killed Mr.
Burns.
You have to kill the head vampire.
You're the head vampire? No, I'm the head vampire.

What the hell's so funny? [ Inhales .]
At the Apple Biscuit CafÃ© where the smiles are free, don't you know Sven Inqvist studied the menu.
Finally, he ordered the same thing he has every day.

Well, sir, I think it is time to turn this pledge drive over to Troy McClure.
I can't keep up this pace forever.

Hi, I'm Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such telethons as ''Out with Gout '88'' and ''Let's Save Tony Orlando's House.
'' Folks, do you realize without your support public television can't afford to bring you such award-winning shows as Edward the Penitent? I'm really, really, really sorry.
I'm afraid sorry doesn't cut it with this pope.
- Oh-ho.

What the hell? Oh, we got a call.

Some idiot actually called in.
- Hello.
What's your name? - Marge Simpson.
- [ Screams .]
- I'd like to pledge $30.
Oh, thank you.
Marge, it's public TV.
They never have anything good.
Where are the Geraldos? Where are the Eubankses-ses? They need our support.
Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet.
- The ballet? Whoo-hoo! - You like ballet? Marjorie, please.
I enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew.
Ahh, ballet.

- Hi, Marge.
I was wondering if you had a power sander I could borrow.
- Homer? - Nope.
- [ Whirring .]
- That's one right there.
All right.
But, remember, it's mine.
That's what ballet is? [ Groans .]
You promised.
You can't back out like when you volunteered for that army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
Mr.
Simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness and the loss of equilibrium? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just give me the serum.
[ Chuckles .]
It was worth it.
- [ Body Thuds On Floor .]
- [ Homer Giggling .]
- Hey, Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home? - I can't.
I gotta take my wife to the ballet.
[ Chuckles .]
Gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh? Hmm? Mmm, invisible cola.
Mmm.
[ Short Laugh .]
Time to stick it to the man.
Hey, hey.
Careful there, Homer.
I heard somebody lost an arm in there once.

Okay.
Would you two like to go to the ballet? - [ Snorts .]
That's girl stuff.

Homer, are you just holding on to the can? - Your point being? -[ Men Laughing .]
- I envy you and Homer.
- Thank you.
- Why? - If you ever met my ex-husband, you'd understand.
All he ever did was eat, sleep and drink beer.
- Your point being? - And to top it off, he's been stiffing me on child support for the last four months.
[ Groans .]
Well, you were unlucky.
But there are a lot of good men out there.
Hey, can I throw up in your bathroom? - I'll buy something.
- [ Shudders .]
Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines.
That's why I had the firemen write me a note.
''Mrs.
Simpson: While we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down.
'' D'oh! Lumber has a million uses.
I'm disappointed in you, but it turns out I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers.
In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night.
Marge, that's twice.
I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman.
Homer, please.
You know it's hard for me to make friends.
[ Laughs .]
Oh, Marge, we should do this every Thursday.
Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk.

- Oh, look.

- When will you be home? - I'm not sure.

Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a babysitter.
Oh, Lisa.
Haven't you seen Home Alone? If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.
You're absolutely right, Homer.
We don't need a babysitter.
Wait a second.
Mmm.
You kids do need a babysitter.
Blast that infernal card.
Don't give that card to me.
- Here you go-- No! - [ Doorbell Rings .]

Didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police? - Marge, you're the levelheaded friend I never had.

- Ooh! [ Screams .]
It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal just because I didn't take her to the ballet.
- That's exactly how Dillinger got started.
- Really? I don't wanna be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up.
Marge, it's a matter of principle.
I just can't let that deadbeat win again.
You're with me, aren't ya? [ Thinking .]
I should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
- [ Groans .]
- Marge, there's no reason for you to get dragged into this.
Once we lose the cops, I'll let you out.
Well, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose.

- Hey.
You're a good friend, Marge.
- Mmm.

This cross-country flight from the law would be hell if we didn't stick together.
Hey.

It's amazing how through all this adversity, we managed to stick together.

- [ Gasps .]
- Cool.
I always knew someday Mom would violently rise up - and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors.
- Aw, shut your yap.
At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion.
Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women leading to anarchy of biblical proportions.
It's in Revelations, people! Look.
We're only two miles from the state line.
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna be okay.
My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield.
That's it.

Ruth, that's a lot of hooey.
It's not over until it's over.
I'm sorry.
I should've asked first.
No, Marge.
You did it.
We really are gonna make it now.
Oh, no! They're headed right for the Grand Chasm.
Oh, my God! They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson.
And it's all my fault! Marge.
Marge! - Homer? - Look, Marge.
I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband.
I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub.
I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car.
I'm sorry-- Oh, well, let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.
You're right.
I am lucky to have him.
But, please, Marge, don't drive into that chasm! [ Together.]

Once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump.
- Homer, this is terrible.
- Okay.
Okay.
I'll take care of it.
- Hmm? - [ Moaning .]
[ All Moaning .]
I told you this was a bad idea.
All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline.
Hey, Krusty.
I'm bringing back the-- You just keep right on driving.
[ Grunts .]
There we go.
That's the last I'll see of Mr.
Trampoline.
Yep, it's finally gone.
D'oh! [ Grunting .]
If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now.
[ Animal Howling .]
I'm thirsty.
[ Screams .]
- Checkmate, Mr.
Trampoline.
- [ Whirring .]
[ Homer Yelling .]
Oh.
! All right.
All right.
You win for now but someday you'll rust! Rust, I tell ya! [ Hysterical Laughter.]
Dad.
Dad? - You really wanna get rid of this trampoline? - Uh-huh.
Observe.
A bike lock.
[ Chain Rattles, Lock Clicks .]
Now just turn around and count to three.
One, two, three.
Uh, better make it five.
- [ Chain Rattles .]
- All right.
I got me a bed.
[ Dolph .]
Shh.
! Quiet.
You'll wake up old man Simpson.
[Jimbo .]
Hey, no more trampoline.
[ Dolph .]
Let's jump on the car instead.
- [ Metal Thudding .]
- [ Boys Grunting .]
Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea.
But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things.
If it were up to you all we'd ever do is work and go to church.
- That's not true.
- Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
I can name 1 0 things.
Um - I made sloppy joes.
- [ Scoffs .]
That's not fun.
Kids, tell me the truth.
Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time? - Um.
- Um.
- Well.
- Uh-- You should've called.
I was very worried.
We're on a tight budget here.
Bart, watch your language.
You are not going to perform that operation yourself.
[ Groans .]
- See, Marge? - I didn't realize people saw me that way.
- Are you mad? - No, I'm fine.
I'm going to my sisters' now.
- [ Door Slams .]
- [ Car Tires Squealing .]
[ Ned .]
Careful there, Marge.
You almost nicked me.
Well, your blood pressure is off the chart.
And I don't like this urine sample one bit.
You're headed for a nervous breakdown.
You need Brad Goodman.
His infomercial plays round the clock on Channel 77.
- [ Applause .]
- Thank you, Martha Quinn.
There you have it.
Unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities.
She's one of my favorites.
I loved her in the thing I saw her in.
You know, my course can help you with every personality disorder in the ''feel bad'' rainbow.
Let's look at the rainbow.
What's in there? [ Reading List .]
Geriatric Profanity Disorder, or G.
P.
D.
And chronic nagging, nagging, nagging, nagging, nagg-- - Sorry.
It does that sometimes.
- Nagging.
Nagging.
Mm-mm-mm.
What up, Marge? I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
Oh, hi.
I'm Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such self-help videos as Smoke Yourself Thin and Get Confident, Stupid.
Well, now I'm here to tell you about the only real path to mental health.
That's right.
It's the Brad Goodman something or other.
- Marge, can I go outside and play? - Shh.
A few weeks ago, I was a washed-up actor with a drinking problem.
Then Brad Goodman came along and gave me this job and a can of fortified wine.
[ Loud Gulp .]
Ahh! Sweet liquor eases the pain.
And now I'd like to introduce the man who will put the ''you'' in ''impr-you-vement.
'' - Brad Goodman.
- Thank you so much, Troy.
And, by the way, I'm not happy you're still drinking.
But, at least you're down to one from more than 50.
- [ Applause .]
- Folks, I'm often asked about my qualifications.
Well, I may not have a lot of ''credentials'' or ''training'' but I'll tell you one thing, I'm a Ph.
D.
in pain.
Now, let me show you how you can change your life.
Troy, this circle is you.
My God, it's like you've known me all my life.
[ Applause .]
Doctor, you've solved all my problems.
[ Gulps .]
That video really opened my eyes.
I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive coculprit.
By nagging you when you do foolish things I just enable your life-script.
And that sends me into a shame spiral.
Exactly.
So from now on, I'm going to quit nagging and have more fun.
Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies? Uh-oh.
You're in for it now, Dad.
Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
And I feel that you hear my shame.
I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.
- I feel validated by that.
- Good.
I'm glad we had this talk.
Me too.
[ Whistles .]
- Hmm? - Hmm? Wow! For free.
Surplus drums of mayonnaise from Operation Desert Storm.
[ Gasps .]
Brad Goodman is coming to town! Oh, Marge, you and I are fine now.
Who needs Brad Goodman? - [ Clattering .]
- [ Whooping .]
Yee-haw! Yahoo! Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture.
- We know, Dad.
- I just thought I'd remind everybody.
After all, we did agree to attend a self-help seminar.
What an odd thing to say.
- [ Applause .]
- Thank you.
Okay, folks.
Let me hear what's troubling you.
Don't be shy.
Yell it out.
Everybody.
Go.
- I, uh, can't commit to a relationship.
- I'm too nice.
- I have problems with-- - I'm always interrupting people.
Okay.
Okay.
Right now, I want each of you to try something interesting.
There's no trick to it.
It's just a simple trick.
Now, close your eyes for a moment and really listen to that inner voice inside.
Your inner child.
[ Quietly .]
Listen.
What's he saying? Stay the course, Big Ned.
You're doing super.
- Food goes in here.
- It sure does.
[ Italian Accent .]
Hey, Moe.
Whatsa matter? - You no talka with your accent no more.
- Mamma mia.
Principal Skinner, let's try some rage work.
I want you to pretend this dummy right here is your mother.
Okay, I'll try.
[ Chuckles .]
Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel right now.
I'm annoyed with you, Mother.
Not just annoyed, angry.
I'm a grown man now, and I can run my own life.
! [ Grunting .]
[ Whispering .]
Shh-shh.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Moving.
You can sit down now.
We're still going antiquing on Saturday, right, Mother? You see, folks? We're all trying to please someone else.
And as soon as you're not a human being you're a human doing.
- Then what comes next? - A human going! - [ Laughter.]
- Bart, be quiet.
Son, that's wonderful.
Come here.
Come up here.
- What made you yell out that remark? - I don't know.
You just wanted to express yourself, yes? - I do what I feel like.
- That's marvelous.
I-I couldn't have put it better myself.
''I do what I feel like.
'' People, this young man here is the inner child I've been talking about.
- What? - Son, you've never read any of my books, have you? - [ Snorts .]
Earth to boring guy.
- [ Laughter.]
[ Laughs .]
I get that means no, huh? I'm not so old-fashioned.
Your parents have done a fantastic job.
Mama? Papa? Could you come up here? - [ Applause .]
- [ Man .]
Yeah.
! Thank you.
Thank you very much.
This is really remarkable.
Here we have a man with an obvious eating disorder and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle-- I'm sure worn only for shock value.
- [ Groans .]
- And yet they've managed to raise an emotionally healthy son.
- That's fantastic.
- Oh, thank you.
- We can all learn a lot from this young man here.
This-This-- - Rudiger.
Rudiger.
And if we can all be more like little Rudiger-- - His name is Bart.
- His name isn't important.
What's important here is that this lad has fully developed ego integrity with well-defined boundaries.
[ Loud Snoring .]
- [ Laughter.]
- [ Chuckles .]
Isn't he-- People, I am excited.
I can sense a change in the air tonight.
You are all going to start living.
Really living.
[ All .]
Yea! Living! Living! - Be like the boy.
- Be like boy! Be like boy! -Just the ladies.
- Be like boy! Be like boy! - Now, the seniors in the back.
- We like Roy! We like Roy! [ Chattering .]
This is madness.
He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
And how.
[ Laughs .]
A new mood is in the air in Springfield as refreshing as a premoistened towelette.
Folks are finally accepting their feelings and communicating with no holding back.
And this reporter thinks it's about-- [ Beep .]
time.
Of course, all these good vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp who taught us that if it feels good, do it.
[ Gurgling .]
Lise, today I am a god.
Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich? Ew! [ Groans .]
Now, instead of my boring old sermon I'm going to take a page from the book of Bart and do something I've always wanted to do.
Take five, Mrs.
Feesh.
" [ Ragtime .]
- " [ Discordant .]
- Wait.
Wait.
I can do this.
- " [ Resumes .]
- Wait.
Wait.
Hold on.

The wireless was an invention by Guglielmo Marconi.
Who can tell me what his first message was? - Uh-- - I want-a change-a my name-a.
- [ Laughing .]
- Ah, good one, Milhouse.
Anyone else? The first message by wireless.
- It was-- - Our 1 0th caller will receive tickets to Supertramp.
[ Laughing .]
Aw, geez.
Everybody's a comedian.
I'm blue.
Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
- Aw, man! - [ All Spitting .]
[ Cars Honking, Crashing .]
[ Groans .]
Lise, everyone in town is acting like me.
So why does it suck? It's simple, Bart.
You've defined yourself as a rebel.
In the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted.
I see.
Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity.
You've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour photo, instant-oatmeal society.
- What's the answer? - This is your chance to develop a new and better identity.
May I suggest good-natured doormat? Sounds good, Sis.
Just tell me what to do.
Springfield will have its first annual Do What You Feel Festival this Saturday whenever you feel like showing up.
It'll be a welcome change from our annual Do As We Say Festival started by German settlers in 1 946.
- [ Ropes Creaking .]
- If elected mayor my first act will be to kill the whole lot of ya and burn your town to cinders.
- [ Whispering .]
Mike's on.
- I know it's on.
Park anywhere.
I'm not gonna lay any rule trip on you today.
"[ Calypso .]
" [ Humming .]
I feel like such a free spirit and I'm really enjoying this so-called ''iced cream.
'' Sir, in the spirit of the festival and everything I-I'd just like to say that-- [ Clears Throat .]
- I love you.
- Hmm? In those colors.
[ Nervous Chuckle .]
Oh, who am I kidding? The boathouse was the time.
- [ Man .]
My God.
They're naked.
- Double your pleasure, Springfield.
I'm sweating.
Let's ride through the car wash.
[ All .]
Ew.
Arr! This picture will serve me well on those lonely nights at sea.
This is great.
I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.
[ Apu .]
Cowabunga! Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.
- Ow! - Eat my shorts, young man.
Good afternoon and welcome to the Do What You Feel Festival.
By the way, this young lady is not my wife, but I am sleeping with her.
I'm telling you this because I'm comfortable with my womanizing.
- Yea! - Arr! And now to usher in this new era of feeling good here's the, uh, Godfather of Soul,James Brown.
" Ow! I feel good " " Huh, I knew that I would now " [ Grunts .]
" I feel good " " Good God I knew that I would, hah " " So good " " So good I got you " [ Yells .]
- [ All Gasp .]
- Hey.
Wait a minute.
Hold on here.
This bandstand wasn't double-bolted.
Huh.
- I didn't feel like it.
- Hey.
I hear you, buddy.
Uh, I don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation but my inner critic says you should've done your job.
Hey, now, Marge.
Let's not ''should'' this fella to death.
Yeah.
Next you'll be laying a guilt-trip on me for not oiling that Ferris wheel.
- [ Loud Screeching .]
- [ Riders Screaming .]
[ Screaming Continues .]
[ Various Animal Noises .]
- [ Screaming .]
- [ Elephant Trumpeting .]
In the, uh, spirit of the occasion, I must tell you what I think.
- You two screwed up royal.
- You know, I really don't feel like being blamed.
- I feel that you should shut up.
- You know, you really irritate me, Skinner.
What with your store-bought haircut and excellent posture.
- Mister, I can't stand the sound of your voice.
- Oh, really? Oh, now, now.
There's no need to resort to violence.
- Aw, sure there is.
- [ Clamoring .]
I knew it.
If only I had nagged more.
God is angry.
We've made a false idol of this Brad Goodman.
No.
You must not blame yourself, Reverend.
You must blame that little boy.
He started it all.
- Get him! - Eep.
[ Crowd Jeering .]
- Here, boy.
In here.
- Huh? Hold on, Son.
[ Engine Puttering .]
So long, suckers.
Damn.
They're very slowly getting away.
- They're heading for the old mill.
- No, we're not.
Well, let's go to the old mill anyway, get some cider.
- [ Man .]
That's a good idea.
- Let's get some cider.
Aw, boy.
If only Bart had been a better role model for everyone.
That's not fair.
The lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
No.
Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick fix.
It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
That's what I've been saying.
We're all fine the way we are.
- [ TVClicks On .]
- Ooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.
- Crank it, Homer.
- You busted up that crack house pretty bad, McGonigle.
Did you really have to break so much furniture? You tell me, Chief.
You had a pretty good view from behind your desk.
Ah, McGonigle eases the pain.
- You're off the case, McGonigle.
- You're off your case, Chief.
[ Chief.]
What does that mean exactly? [ Homer .]
It means he gets results, you stupid chief!.

Dad, sit down.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

- Shh!

You must cherish it.
Seize the day! Can I have some change to go get loaded? Ah.
Finally, a little quiet time to read some of my old favorites.
''Honey Roasted Peanuts.
''Ingredients: Salt ''artificial honey-roasting agents pressed peanut sweepings.
'' - Mmm! - Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner.
- Steak? - Money's too tight for steak.
- Steak? - Mm, sure.
Steak.
Ah.
The last peanut-- overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
Uh-oh.
Something's wrong.
Hmm.
Ow! Pointy.
Eww! Slimy.
Uh-oh! Moving.
Aha! Aw.
Twenty dollars.
I wanted a peanut.
- [ Thinking .]
Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts.
- Explain how.
Money can be exchanged for goods and services.

[ Horn Blows .]

Not again? [ Belches .]
Okay, look.
I made a terrible mistake.
I wandered into a Junior Camper recruitment center, but what's done is done.
I've made my bed, and now I've gotta weasel out of it.
I know you think theJunior Campers are square and ''uncool'' but they also do a lot of neat things-- like sing-alongs and flag ceremonies.
Marge, don't discourage the boy.
Weaseling out of things is important to learn.
It's what separates us from the animals-- except the weasel.
All I've gotta do is take this uniform back after school.
You're lucky.
You only joined theJunior Campers.
I got a dirty word shaved into the back of my head.
[ Gasps .]
What is it with you kids and that word? I'm going to shave you bald, young man until you learn that hair is not a right-- it's a privilege.
What's in the bag, wuss? Huh? Oh, look.
Camper's Pampers.
Ha-ha! - Keep away! - Keep away! - Keep away! Nyah-nyah-nya-nya-nyah! - Keep away! Yeah, whatever.
- You better pretend you want your uniform back, twerp.
- [ Gulp .]
- Keep away! - Keep away! [ Spiritless .]
Oh, no.
Woe is me.
My precious uniform.
Oh.
- Guess what, class? - Time for a surprise quiz? - [ All Gasp .]
That's not what I was gonna say, but it's a good idea.

Should I keep doing it? Well, sir,just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you've got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir.
I'm outta here, man.
- Okay.
Everybody take out your Junior Campers pocketknives.
- Hmm? You guys get to play with knives? - Oh, cool.
A ''spork.
'' - Don't hurt me! Ooh.
Sorry, Bart.
That's a Neddy no-no.
You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife till you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test.
Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway? - Knives are boring.
- Whoa! When I say put your beer on a coaster, I mean it! You call that a knife? This is a knife.

Heh-heh! You don't have a son.

Homer won't wanna go.
So just ask him, and he'll say no.
Then it'll be his fault.
I don't wanna go.
So if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes.

- Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully.
It's our only hope.
Oh, pardon me, Mr.
Let's Ration Everything.
What do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? Water, water everywhere, so let's all have a drink.

We are doomed.

What are you doing to help? Well, since you're all such a big bunch of big ration babies I'll just be in charge of the rationing.

Now, I, uh, hesitate to bring this up but a number of cities have rejuvenated their economies with, uh, legalized gambling.
[ Crowd Murmuring .]
There is an added bonus.
Some of the revenue can go to help our underfunded public schools.
- Well, I like the part about the gambling.
- What do you think, Reverend? Once something has been approved by the government, it's no longer immoral.
- Yea! - By building a casino I could tighten my stranglehold on this dismal town! Yea! - [ Belches .]
- Yea! Well, now.
Are there any objections? [ Man .]
Probably Marge is gonna have some.
[ Crowd Murmuring Marge's Name .]
Actually, I think it might really help our economy.
[ Murmuring Excitedly .]
Very well then.
Instead of fleeing this town I'll stay here and grow fat off kickbacks and slush funds.
Yea! [ Shouting, Cheering .]
This could be a whole new beginning for Springfield.
And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.

Mom, we're having a geography pageant at school and I don't know which state to go as.
In honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of Nevada? No.
Nevada makes my butt look big.
Then how 'bout going as Florida? You enjoy orange juice.
Old people like you.
- Dad, what do you think? - Shh! I'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.

Legalized gambling is a bad idea.
You can build a casino over my dead body.

Aw, come on, Lisa.
There's no reason to-- Let's go see Mom.
[ Grunting .]
Marge, we need to talk.
You're spending too much time at the casino, and I think you may have a problem.
I won $60 last night.
Whoo-hoo! Problem solved! Smithers, I've designed a new plane.
I call it the Spruce Moose, and it will carry 200 passengers from New York's Idlewild Airport to the Belgian Congo in 1 7 minutes! - That's quite a nice model, sir.
- Model? - Mom.
! - Huh? What? Lisa, what's up? - I just had a bad dream.
- Oh, sure.
You just lie down and tell me all about it.
Well, I know it's absurd, but I dreamed the bogeyman was after me, and he's hiding-- [ Screams .]
Bogeyman! You nail the windows shut.
I'll get the gun.

None of this would have happened if you had been here to keep me from acting stupid! Oh, I'm sorry.
I have been spending too much time at the casino.
I'll be around more from now on.
Does this mean you'll help me with my costume? Oh, sure, honey.
I promise.

And she's not! And the geography pageant is tonight! Lisa, your mom still loves you.
It's just that she has a career now.
She's a slot jockey.
But if I don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of Florida I'll be the laughingstock of the whole school.
Oh, it's always something, isn't it? First I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

Fine.
We'll transfer him to the nuclear plant, sir.
Oh, my beloved plant.
How I miss her.
Bah! To hell with this! Get my razor! Draw a bath! - And get these Kleenex boxes off my feet! - Certainly, sir.
- And, uh, the jars of urine? - Oh, we'll hang on to those.
Now, to the plant! We'll take the Spruce Moose! - Hop in! - But, sir-- [ Gasps .]
I said hop in.
[ Panting, Gasps .]

Homer, what is it? Slow down.
Yer getta ferda redda oura.
Think before you say each word.
- You broke a promise to your child.
- What? You promised Lisa to help her with her costume.
You made her cry.
Then I cried.
Then Maggie laughed.
She's such a little trouper.
[ Gasps .]
Lisa's costume! [ Gasps .]
Homer, I didn't realize.
I'm so sorry.
Marge, I want you to admit you have a gambling problem.
You know, you're right, Homer.
Maybe I should get some professional help.
No, no! That's too expensive.
Just don't do it anymore.

- I'm Idaho! - Yes, of course you are.
You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage I can finally look down my nose at you.
You have a gambling problem! That's true.
Will you forgive me? Oh, sure! Remember when I got caught stealing all those watches from Sears? - [ Groans .]
- Well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! And remember when I let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like Santa Claus? - [ Groans .]

Can you swing a sack of doorknobs? - Can I! - You're in.
Here's the sack.
But you gotta supply your own knobs.
So I said to him, ''Look, buddy, your car was upside down when we got here.
And as for your grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!'' Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police? I dunno.
Coast Guard? Homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar? Homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar? And I still don't have my saxophone.

Forty percent of all people know that.
I see.
What do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing? Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes.
Hmm, touchÃ©.

It may interest you to know that for my next crime I'll be pinching the pride andjoy of the Springfield Museum the world's largest cubic zirconia.
Listen, Mr.
Cat Burglar.
I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield Museum day and night for as long as it takes from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time.
- We'll be right back.
- I get to say that! Son, we want to help you catch that plug-ugly yegg.
Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example.
Just stand around and don't steal anything.
- Hey! - We're on our break! - Any sign of the burglar yet? - He'll show.
- How's that? - It's his job.
- How's that? - He's a burglar.

Son, I've come to help you.
I know who the cat burglar is.
- What? - Who? - Huh? Well, well, well.
Before, I was too old and no one wanted my help.
Suddenly, look who comes to old Grampa with-- Wait! Where are you going? Come back.
I'll tell you.
He was right under my nose the whole time.
He lives in my retirement home.
His name is Malloy.
Wow! How'd you track him down, Grampa? Good question.
- On one of my frequent trips to the ground - [ Yelps .]
I noticed Malloy wore sneakers for sneaking! My next clue came just yesterday at the museum.
We felt slighted by your age bashing and started home.
Malloy said, ''I'll catch up with you.
'' I couldn't quite put my fnger on it.
There was something strange about the way he walked.
Much more vertical than usual.
And finally, Malloy, unlike most retired people has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
Aw, Dad, I could kiss ya! Kiss me right here.
It's the only part that still has feeling.
- Mwah! - Hmm.
- [ Angry Shouting .]
- No, wait! I know where the burglar is! - To the retirement home! - [ All .]
Hooray! - [ Man .]
Let's go.
! - [ Angry Shouting .]
And there she is, the world's largest cubic zirconia.
What an eyesore! So, Mr.
Malloy, it seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him.
- How ironic.
- Homer, old chap, well done.
If anyone was going to catch me, I'm glad it was you.
Actually, it wasn't me.
It was my dad, Grampa.
Thanks, Son.
So, you see, old people aren't so useless after all.
Malloy's old, and he outsmarted the lot of you.
And I'm even older, and I outsmarted him! [ Laughing .]
- Shut up.
- I've had my moment.
And of course, I'm happy to return all of your treasured possessions.
- Oh, well, that's nice.
- [ Happy Murmuring .]
- Selma, my dear, your lock of MacGyver's hair.
- Ohh.
Thank you.
I'll add it to the ball.
And little Lisa, here's your saxophone.
Thank you, and thank you, Dad.
Thank you, and thank you, Dad.
You got it back, just like you said you would.
I sincerely regret any inconvenience I may have caused and although I have stolen your material goods let me assure you that your dear town has stolen my heart.
[ All .]
Aww! - Oh, he's so charming.
- Let's let him go.
- Yeah! - Oh, sorry, folks.
Gee, I really hate to spoil this little love-in but Mr.
Malloy broke the law.
And when you break the law, you gotta go to jail.
That reminds me.
Here's your monthly kickback.
You just-- You couldn't have picked a worse time.
I caught the cat burglar.
! I caught the cat burglar.
! That means you! You are the cat burglar! I suppose you're wondering where I hid the millions of dollars I stole over the years.
- Shut up! - Wait a minute.
Maybe we should hear him out.
Where'd you hide the loot, Malloy? It's buried right here in Springfield, under a big ''T.
'' No kidding.
Big ''T,'' huh? Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and sleep.
Yeah, me too.
- I will also go home for sleep.
- [ All Shouting .]
Let me through! I gotta find a big ''T''! There's millions of dollars buried under a big ''T''! - What? -[ People Screaming .]
We need more information.
Very well.
It's buried at 4723 Maple Valley Road.

What's the matter with you, kid? You told me the stream was shallow! Why, you-- I-- [ Chuckling .]
Oh, you.
Oh, kid.
I'll get even with you.
Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town for some unknown reason.
Professor, without knowing precisely what the danger is would you say it's time for our viewers to crack each other's heads open and feast on the goo inside? Yes, I would, Kent.
[ Siren Wailing .]
[ Choir Vocalizing .]
Whoa.
I found something.
[ Excited Chattering .]
[ Woman .]
Come on.
Pull it out.
- It's just a piece of paper.
- It's mine! ''Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure.
''I have already used this time to escape from your jail.

We're bound to find something.
[ Mayor Quimby .]
Mmm.
I guess we're not going to find anything.
[ Otto .]
Uh, how are we gonna get out of here? [ Homer.]
We'll dig our way out! [ Grunting .]

[ Grunting .]
We're having a field trip today.
Ah, Lise, won't it be great to cast off the shackles of the soul-crushing hellhole that is Springfield Elementary? Oh! I'm sorry.
I forgot.
Your class isn't going.
You're right, Bart.
School is for losers.
''And that's how I cured all disease, ended war and reunited the entire cast ofTV's Facts of Life including longtime holdout Tootie.
'' Ohh.
! Sounds like another Pulitzer for me to polish.
Hush, field trip boy! Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize.
How ironic.
Yo! Lise! Lise! - Come back, Lise! Come back! - Why? I'm so much happier here.
And now, Principal Skinner will tell us where we'll be going on this year's field trip.
Thank you, Edna, everyone.
[ Clears Throat .]
Now, class, I wonder who among you can tell me what this is? Oh! Not the box factory again, Seymour.
[ All Groaning .]
This may well prove fascinating.
I know.
I'll just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy.
Class, instead of going to the box factory today we'll be going to the box factory.

The story ofhow two brothers and fve other men parlayed a small business loan into a thriving paper goods concern is a long and interesting one.
And here it is.
It all began with the fling of Form 63 7 / A-- the application for a small business or farm-- Many interesting and important things have been put into boxes over the years.
Textiles, other boxes, even children's candy.
Do any of these boxes have candy in 'em? - No.
- Will they ever? No.
We only make boxes to ship nails.
- Any other questions? - When will we be able to see a finished box, sir? Oh, we don't assemble them here.
That's done in Flint, Michigan.
- Any of your workers had their hands cut off by machinery? - No.
And then the hand started crawling around and tried to strangle everybody? - No, that has never happened.
- Any popped eyeballs? I'm not sure what kind of factory you're thinking of.
We just make boxes here.
This room is the most popular part of our tour.
It's just like the other rooms.
Yes, but with one important difference.
Oh.
We took that out.
Yes, it is just like the other rooms.
- What's that building over there? - That's just a TVstudio where they film Krusty the Clown and other non-box-related programs.
Since it has nothing to do with boxes, I'll just shut these blinds.
- [ All Groaning .]
- Oh, man.
Now, here's my office.
If you'll direct your eyes to the floor, you'll see a yellow line.
Follow it.
It will lead you around my desk and back out the door.
[ Skinner.]
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
I gotta get out of here.
Aha! The perfect escape.
[ Grunts .]
Hmm.
Oh! Ah! Do you work here, little boy? - Yeah.
- Well, then, go right in, sir.
- Yeah.
- Well, then, go right in, sir.
- Bart! - [ Chattering, Shouting .]
I'll handle this.
Simpson, I'm giving you until the count of three to come out.

Now, that's Danish.
Where'd you get it? I stole it from Kent Brockman.
Great! Uh, he didn't touch it, did he? No.
Good job, kid.
What's your name? I'm Bart Simpson.
I saved you from jail.
Oh, I-- I reunited you with your estranged father.

Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip.
Think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker? Well, that'll always be the dream.
But for now, I got a job in the show business.
From now on, I'll be helping Krusty the Clown after school.
Mmm, I don't know, Bart.
You're only 1 0.
I've got a weekend job helping the poor, and I'm only eight.
[ Scoffs .]
That's not a job.
It's a waste of time.
What can poor people pay you? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping them? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody! So, anyway, can I, Mom? - Can I take the job? - Well-- Why not? I remember my first after-school job.
I was in a band.
Hello, everybody.
I'm Archie Bell, and I'm also The Drells.

Looks more like ''Brad Storch.
'' No, it says, ''Betty.
'' ''Betty Symington.

- Oh! It's okay, Son.
Who cares what a bunch of fourth-graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life.
Nothin' else matters.
Thanks, Dad.
That's great advice.
Yep.
Well, that's what got me where I am today.
- Oh.
- There, there.
- Would you sign my picture, Krusty? - Sure, kid.
Get in line.

- Okay, kids, open your books to page 60-- - [ Cell Phone Ringing .]

Meet me in the conservatory chop-chop.
- Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh! I wish I was dead.
Aah! There's cheese in this sandwich! Surely you know I'm lactose intolerant! - Sorry.
- Sorry? Do you know how sick this is going to make me? [ Groans .]
Oh, boy.
Come stand next to the bathroom door.
I want to yell at you some more.

- Dead? Or sick.

Anyway, all you gotta do is say, ''I am waiting for a bus.

- Obnoxious fad? - Ah, don't worry, Son.

Good evening.
Here's an update on last week's nursing-home exposÃ©, ''Geezers in Freezers.
'' It turns out the rest home was adequately heated.
The footage you saw was of a fur-storage facility.
We've also been told to apologize for using the term ''geezers.
'' Now, coming up next, ''The Case of the Cantankerous Old Geezer.
'' - Ohh! Urp! - [ Stomach Grumbles .]
Rancid meat attack! Stupid parasites! Is there no way I can find justice? If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number.
- Boring.
- Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart.
- And now a message from the Church of Latter-day Saints.
- [ Barking .]
- Dad, are you listening to me? - Shh! Lisa! The dog is barking.
All right.
Are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep? No way, man! No way, man! Get yourself another patsy, man! - No way am I wearin' a freakin' wire.
- All right, all right.
- Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone? - Oh, that I'll wear.
We've come up with a camera so tiny it fits into this oversized novelty hat.
[ Groaning .]
Now go get us some incriminating footage.
Remember, you have to get in and out in 1 0 minutes - or you'll suffer permanent neck damage.

- I think I come off very well.
- Monster! Run, children! [ Panicked Shouting .]
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart corporation.
But, sir, I was only following standard procedure.
Ah, true.
But it's also standard procedure to blame any problems on a scapegoat or sacrificial lamb.
Uh-huh.
And if I can obtain for you these animals? I'm sorry, Apu.
I have no choice.
- You can no longer wear this name patch.

And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles.
Now, turn in your pricing gun.
Oh! The other one too.
Oh! Fired after all these years of loyal service.

No! Don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I was unaware! Mr.
Simpson, you misunderstand me.
In my village, this is the traditional pose of apology.
- Oh.
- Now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing.
Many have died needlessly.
I have come to make amends, sir.
At first, I blamed you for squealing.
But then I realized it was I who wronged you.
So I have come to work off my debt.
I am at your service.
You're selling what now? I'm selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
You can't sell that! Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
He's got me there.
- [ Homer .]
Is he still out there? - Yes.
He's raking leaves.
What? That's your job! If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping-- If he wants to make it up to you so badly, I think you should let him.
Okay, okay.
I'll let him.
But then I get a Chipwich.
Okay? It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you.
Back in Rahmatpur, I was considered quite the gourmet.
Hmm.
It certainly is exotic.
- [ Panting .]
- Oh, Lisa, is that too spicy for you? I can see through time.
[ Gulping .]
Stop being such babies.
You can't be afraid to try new things.
For instance, tonight I'm using a-- Apu, what do you call this thing again? - A napkin.
- [ Chuckling .]
Outrageous! All right.
Why do you want to become a part of the Kwik-E-Mart family? Because I like people, and I need a place where I'll be out of the sun.
- Thank you.
- [ Belches .]
Hmm.
He's head and shoulders above everyone else.
- Wait.
There's one more applicant.
- Name? -James Woods.
- Previous job experience? Ooh, uh, gee, True Believer, uh, Salvador, Onion Field, The Hard Way.
Wait-Wait a minute! Those aren't convenience stores.
- That sounds like the resume of a Hollywood movie star.
- Uh, yeah, well-- Huh! [ Both Gasp .]
James Woods! Why would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart? [ Chuckles .]
Well, uh, to be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm gonna be playing this tightly wound convenience-store clerk And, you know, I kinda like to research my roles and really get into it.
For instance, True Believer.
I actually worked in a law firm for two months.
And in the film Chaplin-- I had a little cameo in that-- I actually traveled in time back to the '20s where-- - Well, [ Chuckles .]
I-I've said too much.
- Welcome aboard.
Hm? Hm? Hm? Hm? - Good morning, sir.
- [ Screams .]
Relax, please.
You do not have anything I have not seen before.
- What the-- - Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there.
- " La la la la " - [ Groans .]
- Apu, we usually store our cans in the cupboard.
- Oh, they'll never move that way.
Mmm! Corn! Haven't had that in a while.
Yeah! Delicious corn.
- [ Together.]
Bye.
- Hm.
Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie.
You wanna come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart? Please, Mrs.
Simpson.
I-- I cannot go there.
That is the scene of my spiritual depantsing.
Umm, well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart.
"[ Muzak .]
Ooh! That's a good price for 1 2 pounds of nutmeg.
Ooh! Great selection and rock-bottom prices.
But where is the love? [ Man On P.
A.
.]
Attention, Monstromart shoppers.
Just a reminder that we love each and every one of you.
- [ Shoppers .]
Aww! - Hm! Excuse me, ma'am.
Where are the lampshades? Ma'am? Oh! I've killed her! It's all happening again! [ Sobbing, Screaming .]
Mm-hmm.
[ Both Gasp, Scream .]
[ Both Gasp, Scream .]
Help me! Help me! [ Gurgling .]
Mmm! It's cran-tastic! Uh, Mrs.
Simpson, the express line is the fastest line not always.
That old man up front, he is starved for attention.
He will talk the cashier's head off.
Ah, there's an interesting story behind this nickel.
In 1 957, I remember it was.
I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast.
I set the toaster to three-- medium brown.
- Let's go to that line.
- But that's the longest.
Yes, but look-- all pathetic single men.
Only cash, no chitchat.
[ Rapid Cash-register Sounds .]
Mmm! Seventy-fve, 85, 90 and a dollar.
Thank you and come again.
Hey, wait a minute! Hey! Uh, eh, could I just ask you a question? Did you-- Huh! Did you believe that? I mean, the way I gave you the change? Did I sound like a real Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kinda guy? - Actually, I thought it was a little labored.
- Oh.
You gotta lose yourself in the moment, man.
Yeah.
Like-- Yeah! Okay.
Great.
Okay.
Let-Let's just try that again.
Okay? Come on.
Hey.
Come on.
Hey-ey-ey! Hey, get over here! Okay.
Now, you're you, I'm me.
- I'm me? - Hey, don't jerk me around, fella.
[ All Gobbling, Gulping .]
- Pass the chutney.
- Apu, you've been so helpful.
If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart.
- And he taught me how to play the shehnai.
- " [ Shrill Notes .]
[ Shudders .]
That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
And he taught me how to do this.
[ Grunting .]
I got out of school, 'cause I told 'em I was mangled in a car wreck.
- Thank you all for the kind praise.
- Well, you deserve it.
All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
[ Beating .]
[ Electrical Crackling .]

Ahh.
Apu friend me good.
I think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
I feel that way too.
You see, whether igloo, hut or lean-to or a geodesic dome there's no structure I have been to which I'd rather call my home.

Everything really wrapped up nicely.
Hmm.
Much quicker than usual.
I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
And we've all found happiness, every one of us.
- [ Apu Crying .]
- [ TV Clicks On .]
Hey, what's that sound? [ Crying Continues .]
"Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart " " I do " Hey, he's not happy at all! He lied to us through song! I hate when people do that! I can't lie to myself, you know.
I do miss my Kwik-E-Mart.
Isn't there anything you can do to get your job back? - I must go to the head office and appeal my case.
- I'm coming with you! I got you fired.
It's the least I can do.
Well, the least I could do is absolutely nothing.
But I'll go you one better and come along.
- But, sir, the head office is in India.
- Okay.
- Dad, that's over 1 0,000 miles away.
- I'm aware of that! - That's over 1 6,000 kilometers.

-Are we in India yet? - No.
-Are we in India yet? - No.
Oh, wait now we are.

You have to do something about this.
Uh! How can it be the same movie if they've changed my character from a tightly wound convenience-store clerk to a jittery Eskimo firefighter? Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Well, actually, that's-- that's a pretty good explanation.
Now, this is gross-- This'll be gross points, right, on this new-- Okay.
Yeah, 'cause those monkey-- Yeah.
Okay.
Great.
Okay.
Look.
Book me a flight rent me an igloo, and tell those dorks at the Kwik-E-Mart that, boom, I am out of here.
I'm a dot.
I'm gone.

I'm sorry, Apu.
But remember-- "Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart " Do you mind? I'm not in the mood.
Apu, if it'll make you feel any better I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
Yes, yes.
You are right, sir.
I've got to accept my fate.
I have feared it for long enough now.
I'm going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart, and I am going to face my demon! Oh, that'll work out great! We're out of Lucky Charms.

Malibu Stacy, America's favorite eight-and-a-half-incher.
In 1 959, homemaker Stacy Lavelle had a design and a dream.
The design? Malibu Stacy.
The dream? To mass-market a fashion doll that was also edible.
Kids didn't much like the taste of dried onion meal, but they loved the doll.
A second, plastic Malibu Stacy took America by storm.
Just ask the owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection.
: Waylon Smithers of Springfield.
Hello, Malibu Stacy collectors.
I'll see you at StacyCon '94, at the San Diego Airport Hilton.

And what does Stacy think ofher 35 years of success and millions of friends worldwide? Don't ask me.

[ Announcer, Chuckling .]
She sure is.
Well, that's the tour.
- If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer-- - I have one.
- Yes? - Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake? [ Chuckles .]

That would be quite a feat.
Stacy Lavelle is a total recluse.
She hasn't appeared in public in 20 years.
Here, I'm writing an article on her for my next Malibu Stacy newsletter.

You're quite good at turning me on.
Um, you probably should ignore that.

- No, it couldn't be! - [ Buzzing .]

Miss Lavelle? I'd like to talk to you about Malibu Stacy? Do you have any idea how many kids have tried to track me down? - Am I the first? - Yes.
I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
Thinking too much gives you wrinkles.
All right! I've been waitin' nine years to get my Frisbee back.

- But what do you expect me to do? - Change what she says.
- It's your company.
- [ Scoffs .]
Not since I was forced out in 1 97 4.
They said my way of thinking just wasn't cost-effective.
- That's awful! - Well, that, and I was funneling profits to the Vietcong.
But you are Malibu Stacy.
As long as she has your name, you have the responsibility! I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the Simpson name on it.
I may have had things in common with Stacy in the beginning but 30 years of living her lifestyle taught me some very harsh lessons.
Five husbands: Ken,Johnny,Joe Dr.
Colossus, Steve Austin.
But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can everyone.
I'm sure we can think of something together.
- Come on! - Not now.

No, you're not! [ Slurping, Swallowing .]

You and I are gonna make our own talking doll.
She'll have the wisdom of Gertrude Stein and the wit of Cathy Guisewite.
The tenacity of Nina Totenberg and the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
And to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt.
- [ Exhales .]
- All right.
We'll make your doll! - [ Pounding On Door .]
- [ Gasps .]
Stacy, please.
I must have you back.
Just come for a ride with me in my mobile command unit.
Joe, I told you.
It's over.
- Release me from your kung fu grip.
- Fine.
I'll bomb your house into the ground, missy! Make sure you get my mom's hair just right! Um, I think we'll use someone different for the hair.
- How about me? - There's something not quite-- - How 'bout me? - [ Stammering .]
- How 'bout me? - You all have hideous hair! - [ Simpsons Gasping .]
- I mean, from a design point of view.
- Oh, well, if you put it that way.

How 'bout ''Blabbermouth, theJerky Doll forJerks''? How 'bout Minerva, after the Roman goddess of wisdom? Mm, not enough commercial appeal.
''Wendy Windbag''? ''Ugly Doris''? - ''Hortense, the Mule-Faced Doll''? - I think we should name her after Lisa.
We'll call her ''Lisa Lionheart.
'' No, ''Loudmouth Lisa!'' ''Stupid Lisa Garbage Face!'' I can't stand this any longer.
Somebody please pay attention to me! Hello! Pay attention to me.
Look at me! I'm Bart, I'm Bart.
Look at me.

This is great.
! They're really gonna sell our doll.
! It wasn't difficult.
I just told them who I was and who you were.
- They couldn't resist.
- Really? Well, I didn't tell them who you were.
Gentlemen, we've got to sink this Lisa Lionheart doll and fast.
It's time to call in a favor from Washington.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
I'll take care of it personally.

- Dad? - Mm-hmm? My new doll's much better than Malibu Stacy.
Do a newscast about her.

Oh, please, honey.
Daddy's job is to bring people important news.
I'm very busy preparing a report about the 40th anniversary of Beetle Bailey.
Oh, Daddy, that is boring.
- Talk about the dolly! - Well, you were right about the Berlin Wall.
Though it was unusual to spend this reporter found it impossible to stop talking.
It's just really fascinating news, folks.
- Good night.

Oh, and the president was arrested for murder.
More on that tomorrow night.
Or you can turn to another channel.
Oh.
Do not turn to another channel.
Our one effort to put a stop to this Lisa Lionheart thing has failed miserably.
Gentlemen, we have to reinvent Malibu Stacy for the '90s.
We'll stay here all night, if need be.
- Can we order Chinese food? - Yes.

- D'oh! It's a lovely day for a launch here, live at Cape Canaveral at the lower end of the Florida peninsula.
And the purpose of today's mission is truly, really electrifying.
That's correct, Tom.
The lion's share of this flight will be devoted to she study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny screws.
Unbelievable.
And just imagine the logistics of weightlessness.
Of course, this could have literally millions of applications here on earth in everything from watchmaking to watch repair.
Boring.
Oh, no! The batteries! - Now let's look at the crew a little.
- They're a colorful bunch.
They've been dubbed the Three Musketeers.

And we laugh legitimately.
There's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.

[ Both Sigh .]
Sir, we've run into a serious problem with the mission.
These Nielsen ratings are the lowest ever.
Oh, my God! We've been beaten by ''A Connie Chung Christmas''! People, we're in danger of losing our funding.
America isn't interested in space exploration anymore.
Maybe we should finally tell them the big secret-- that all the chimps we sent into space came back superintelligent.
No, I don't think we'll be telling them that.
[ Chittering .]
We need a fresh angle to get the public interested.
The public see our astronauts as clean-cut, athletic go-getters.
- They hate people like that.
- Well, who do they like? Here are the most popular personalities on television or ''TV.

Hello, is this NASA? - Yes.
Good.
Listen.
I'm sick of your boring space launches.
I'm just an ordinary, blue-collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV.
- How did you get this number? - Shut up! And another thing, how come I can't get no Tang around here? Also-- - Hold on a second.

[ Barney Burps, Groans .]
Thank you.
I'm afraid that's all we have time for.
Now, of course, only one of you will be chosen to go into space.
So the next few weeks will be a grueling series of tests to determine which one of you is most qualified.
Oh, and, Mr.
Gumble, for the duration of the training, there'll be no more beer.
What? Three whole weeks with only wine? - I'll go crazy! - And may the best man win.
He's got a big drinking problem.
Could embarrass the program.
Meet me up in that tree later, and I'll tell you more.
Wow, my father, an astronaut.
I feel so full of-- - What's the opposite of shame? - Pride? No, not that far from shame.
- Less shame? - Yeah.
You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions.
First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary then apprehensive, then kind of sleepy then worried and then concerned.
But now I realize that being a spaceman - is something you have to do.
- Who's doing what now? Well, here I am, right on time.
I don't see Barney ''Let's Crash the Rocket Into the White House and Kill the President'' Gumble.

And in a way, you're both winners.
But in another more accurate way, Barney is the winner.

You didn't even know how to use a touch-tone.
But I still respected you, and I always will, no matter what.

- Homer, you already dialed.
- Oh.
But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life.
You're right, Marge.
Just like the time I could've met Mr.

The entire day, I kept saying, ''I'll go a little later.
I'll go a little later.
'' And then when I got there, they told me he just left.
And when I asked a mall guy if he would ever come back again he said he didn't know.

And we'd like to-- [ Shouts .]
[ All Screaming .]
Ladies and gentlemen, we've just lost the picture but what we've seen speaks for itself.
The Corair spacecraft has apparently been taken over-- conquered, if you will-- by a master race of giant space ants.
It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earthmen or merely enslave them.
One thing is for certain: There is no stopping them.
The ants will soon be here.
And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.
I'd like to remind them that as a trusted TV personality I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.

Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth.
I bet he'd enjoy it even more than me.
Sure.
Anything for Neddy.
Here you go.
Wow, thanks.
Now I have four children.
You will be called ''Scarface.
'' Wow, Flanders.
This is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Ooh, I guess it's time for me to duck again.
No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders, my friend.
! - What did he say? - I don't know.
Something about being gay.
Homer, that's our wedding photo.
- Marge, quit living in the past.
- [ Groans .]
Heydilly-ho, window buddy.
Just wondering if you'd like to come give the new pool table a whirl.
I'll be there.
And this time you can be the nacho man.
Dad and Ned Flanders friends? Heh.
What's next? A's on Bart's report card? Hey! Uh, be careful there, Homer.
That is sort of a new table.
- [ Chuckles .]
- Watch this, Ned.
They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese.
[ Gasps .]
Now you got a lawsuit on your hands.
Just kidding.
- What's wrong,Jeremiah? - It's not fair.
My brotherJoseph has a sin to confess.
I wish I had one too.
Oh, don't you see? You do have a sin to confess.
The sin of envy.
[ Bleating .]
That's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do? - Boring! Let's watch something else.
- Aww! Now, boys.
Mr.
Simpson is the guest.
He gets to decide what to watch.
- Yeah.
- [ Clicking Remote Control .]
Hey, what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.
Sure didelly do.
Over 230 channels locked out.
Okay, boys, time for bed.
Say good night.
Good night, Daddy! Good night, Uncle Homer! Oh, Uncle Homer.
Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family I want you to get to know my family.
- Hey, everyone! - Hey.
I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend.
Hey, I don't want no people in here with their ''evils of alcohol'' rap.
Wait a second.
You're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
''And truly she was my friend Flicka.
'' [ Sniffs .]
- [ Gasps .]
- If this gets out, the next words you say will be muffled by your own butt! [ Tires Screech .]
- Honey, I'm so glad you're home.
- Can't talk.
See Flanders.
- Later sex.
- [ Groaning .]
Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat the middleman who jacked up the price and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughterhouse.
Hiya, Flanders.
Ooh, dinner.
May I join you? [ Grunts .]
- [ Gasps .]
- Mmm.
[ Gasps .]
[ Chuckling .]
Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work.
Uh, yeah.
Ajudge made me do that once too.
Stupid lack of public urinals.
Hey,just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm coming with you! Oh-- Heh, well-- [ Chuckles .]
Th-That sounds super duper.
Oh, you poor, unfortunate man.
Let's get you out of those clothes immediately.
And we'll do whatever we can about the smell.
But I-- All right.
Oh, come on! We've been here for 1 5 minutes.
Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us? Homer, maybe you'd have more fun at Moe's tonight.
Ah, for some reason, Moe's always closed on Wednesdays.
''And then they realized they were no longer little girls.
They were little women.
'' [ Sniffs .]
Come on.
Come on! Just give 'em the slop and let's get out of here.
Oh, I can do it faster than that! Mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm.
Wow! Look at that enthusiasm! This is front-page material.
Homie, I'm very proud of you.
But don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too.
Oh, of course you'd say something like that, Marge.
You've hated Ned for years.
In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.
- That was you! - Love, Marge.
Don't hate.
Love.
The Flanders are a bunch of geeks, man.
The ''Flandereses'' are not geeks! Okay.
Rod and Todd are.
And the wife has a thing for me.
But she hides it behind a mask of low-key hostility.
But we've got to give this thing a chance.
I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.
- No way,JosÃ©.
- Yes way.
Don't worry, Bart.
It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons.
My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-aleck quip and by next week, we'll be back to where we started from ready for another wacky adventure.
- Ay, caramba.
! - That's the spirit.
Don't worry.
I brought my ''Rappin'Ronnie Reagan''tape.
It always makes the trip go faster.
"Well, well, well " "W-W-W-W-W-W-Well, well, well " [ Chuckling .]
You know something? He did say ''well'' a lot.
" Well, well, well W-W-Well, w-w-well " " Well, well, w-w-w-well Well, well, well, well " More.
Come along.
Keep going.
More.
More.
Right there.
Let her go.
Okay, let's go boating.
! - How are my boys doin', Homer? - They're fine.
There.
I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.
Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry.
Our boys don't eat sugar.
But why would the advisory board give us bad advice? - No sugar! - [ Both Groaning .]
Thank you, but we're not allowed.
Ah, it's okay.
There's no sugar in pixie sticks.
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Hmm.
- Don't hog it all, smelly head! - Go to hell, zit face! - Give me that sugar! - [ Both Groaning .]
[ Cackling .]
I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders.
If this were a more perfect world we'd all be known as the Flimpsons.
So here's to my best friend, Ned.
[ Sighs .]
Well, sir my entire family is very touched and-- - Food fight! -[ Bart .]
Yeah.
! - [ Homer .]
"Da-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na " - Mmm.
- [ All Shouting .]
- No-- No! [ Grunting .]
- Whatcha doin'? - We're headin' back.
Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Okay.
But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Too late! [ Groans .]
Oh, Lord, please give me the strength - to endure Homer Simpson's friendship.
- [ Boat Engine Rewing .]
- [ Homer Shouting .]
- [ Crashes .]
Hmm, your car.
Boy, what are the odds, huh? [ Chuckling .]
Cheers to Homer Simpson for all his recent charity work! - [ Together.]
Yea! - [ Grunting .]
Jeers to this rusty tailgate.
" [ Whistling Hymn .]
- There's Homer.
There's Homer too.
- [ Screaming .]
That's also Homer.
That's Homer! Huh? [ Groans .]
- [ Shouts .]
- What's the matter, Ned? - I-- I think I hate Homer Simpson.
- [ Gasps .]
[ Yells .]
Marge I think I hate Ted Koppel.
No, wait.
I find him informative and witty.
Night.
[ Snoring .]
- Off the rim! - Oh! Almost.
Boy, that was close.
Hey, what's up for today, Neddy? Uh-- [ Sighs .]
Ah, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother.
Family only, you know? Right.
No reporters.
[ Sighs .]
No.
I-- I-- I mean just the Flanders family.
Oh, okay.
Oh, boy! Grandma! - We're not going anywhere.
- But you said-- Uh, sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings we have to say things that aren't exactly-- - Lies make BabyJesus cry.
- [ Sighs .]
Neddy! Neddy! Let's get in a quick nine down at the Pitch 'n' Putt.
[ Engine Rewing, Tires Screeching .]
[ Engine Rewing, Tires Screeching .]
Neddy! Neddy! - [ Groaning .]
- He's gaining on us! - I'm scared! - [ Crying .]
Come on, Ned! Move this thing! I can't! It's a Geo! [ Grunting .]
[ Screaming .]
- [ Groaning .]
- [ Groaning .]
[ Groaning .]
Hmm.
I guess he didn't see me.
We did it! We got rid of-- [ Siren Blaring .]
[ Chuckling .]
I told you, Officer.
I'm not hepped up on goofballs.
Yeah, right.
Ned Flanders.
I never would have imagined.
[ Gasping .]
Oh-- Oh-- Ah-- - Oh-- Oof!.
- High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs! Yeah, where's your messiah now, Flanders? Ah.
[ Bells Tolling .]
Oh, I can't do it, Maude.
I can't face their accusing eyes.
Oh, don't worry, Ned.
This is a house of love and forgiveness.
- [ Man .]
There he is, Ned Flanders.
- [ Woman .]
The fallen one.
- The evil one.
- I bet he's the one that wrote ''Homer'' all over the bathroom.
Oh, I-I think we should leave.
Hey, Flanders, over here! I got us some kick-ass seats! [ Moans .]
[ Clearing Throat .]
Before I get started on today's sermon, entitled ''What Ned Did'' I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work.
- [ Applauding .]
- [ Kissing .]
I live to give.
- [ Moans .]
- That's beautiful.
We appreciate the kisses.
Now, let us bow our heads in a silent prayer of thanksgiving.
[ Nose Whistling .]
[ Whistling Continues .]
Stop it! Breathe through your damn mouth! - Oh! - [ Gasping .]
Oh, can't you see this man isn't a hero? He's annoying.
He's very, very annoying! Well, Ned Flanders is just jealous.
Ah, the guy's hepped up on goofballs.
Let's sacrifice him to our God! Come on.
We did it all the time in the '30s.
[ Chattering .]
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - [ Gasps .]
- How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that.
He's a wonderful, kind, caring man.
Maybe even more so than me.
There have been times when I lost patience with him even lashed out at him but this man has turned every cheek on his body.
If everyone here were like Ned Flanders there'd be no need for heaven.
We'd already be there.
[ Group Sighs .]
[ Clears Throat .]
Um-- Well, I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology.
We were wrong to doubt him.
- Hey, that guy's right! - Yeah.
[ Chattering .]
That was a very nice thing you did, Homie.
[ Sniffs .]
Th-- Thank you.
Thank you so much, Homer.
You really are a-- [ Sniffs .]
- You're a true friend.
- Right back at ya, buddy.
[ Moans .]
Now, how about that game at the Pitch 'n' Putt? Just try and stop me.
I don't get it, Lise.
You said everything would be back to normal.
But Homer and Flanders are still friends.
Yeah.
Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
Guess what, everyone! My Great-uncle Boris died and left us his old country house! There's only one catch.
They say it's haunted.
But I'm sure we can prove 'em wrong by spending the weekend there.
- Hididilly-ho, neighbor! - Get lost, Flanders.
Okilly-dokilly.

- Hi, Mom.
[ All Chomping, Swallowing .]
After breakfast, me and Milhouse are going down to the ravine.
We got a tip from a six-year-old that there's a dead Martian down there.
And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet.
- Wanna come with me, Daddio? - I'd love to, honey but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking contest today.
- Think you'll win? - Son, when you participate in sporting events it's not whether you win or lose, it's how drunk you get.
- Gotcha.
Well, gotta go.
- [ Homer, Lisa .]
Me too.
Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
- Push her down, Son.
- No one's going anywhere.
We're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
- [ Gasps .]
- [ Gasps .]
Oh, dear God, no! [ Panting, Struggling .]
I think you'll find that escape is impossible.
Now, each one of you take a floor and get started.
- I call the basement.
- [ All .]
Fine.
D'oh? D'oh! - [ Squeaking .]
- I'm tired.
I'm hungry.
Can't we just buy a new house? Oh, Bart, cleaning doesn't have to be a chore.
Here, work to the music.
"You load 1 6 tons and what do you get " "Another day older and deeper in debt " - Amen, Ernie.
- " [ Continues .]
- [ Sputtering, Engine Starts .]
- [ Grunting .]
- All done.
- You're not done.
I want you to throw away these old calendars and TVGuides.
Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy.
Sure, it's not 1 985 right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TVGuides.
So many memories.
''Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter.
'' Oh, I'll never forget that episode.
- Pyle! - Shazam! - Pyle! - Shazam! - Pyle! - Shazam! [ Laughs .]

Stop remembering TV and get back to work.
What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain? - [ Vacuum Whirring .]

or a really stupid prize.

- KBBL is gonna give me something stupid.
[ Grampa .]
Bart, I'm having palpitations! Can't tie up the line, Grampa.

- There.
Isn't that a lot better? Now you can do whatever you want, but don't mess up the house.

Pretty weird.

Let's try one more number.
- [ Phone Rings .]
- Hello.
- KBBL is gonna give me something stupid! - Well, hot dog, we have a ''wiener.
'' - [ Alarm Sounds .]
- Hello? - I won! I won! You win your choice of $1 0,000 or-- What's our gag prize this week, Bill? [ Bill Laughs .]
A full-grown African elephant.
Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty but I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant.
He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
- [ Marty Whispering .]
The kid wants the elephant.
- We don't have a damn elephant.
- Don't whisper into the mike.
- [ Clears Throat .]
Kid, the elephant's a gag prize.
- Nobody takes the gag prize.
You want the cash.
- I want the elephant.
[ Laughs .]
Stick it to the man.
No, wait! We'll call you back.
Bart, with $1 0,000, we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like love.
Or double-ply windows.
They look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill.
Well, they will.
You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing which is, that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
- Lisa, go to your room.
- [ Man Laughing .]
We appreciate you coming down, but, look, kid.
The thing is, uh-- [ Chuckles .]
we don't have an elephant.
[ Laughs .]
Come on, kid,just take the money, huh? Otherwise, we might get fired.
- You don't want us to get fired, do you? - Eh, either way.
[ Both Gasp .]
We think we know how your mind works, Bart, so how 'bout this? We pay your principal $1 0,000 to pull down his pants - and keep 'em down for the rest of the school year.
- [ Laughs .]
- I'll do it, Bart.
- Um no.
Okay, okay.
What if we use the 1 0,000 to surgically transform Skinner here into a-- some kind of a lobster-like creature? Well, now wait just a minute.
That wasn't discussed with me.
Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.
- Hey! - Whee! Where's my elephant? - " [ Static, Mellow Music .]
- [ Bart .]
Where's my elephant? Where's my elephant? - " [ Mellow .]
- Where's my elephant? Hey, they're playing ''The Elephant Song.

Reminds me of elephants.
So, isn't that what we're all asking in our own lives? Where's my elephant? I know that's what I've been asking.

Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped with angry calls and letter bombs.
- And it's all your fault.
- Yes, it is, ma'am.
This is the DJ-3000.
It plays CDs automatically and it has three distinct varieties of inane chatter.

Hey, hey, how about that weather out there? Whoa, that was the caller from hell.
Well, hot dog, we have a ''wiener.
'' Man, that thing's great.

Hey, you, elephant! Lift me up on your back, man.
Whoo! [ Marge Gasps .]
Bart! [ Grunts .]
Cool! [ Chuckles .]
He tried to kill me.
I really think this is a bad idea.
Marge, I agree with you in theory.
In theory, Communism works.
In theory.
Look, he thinks he's people.
[ Trumpets .]
I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
[ Trumpets .]
- What's he yelling about? - He's hungry.
Here you go, Stampy.
Eat it slow.
It has to last for-- You ate it too fast.
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move, it wouldn't get so hungry.
You can't do that, Dad.
It's cruel! Oh, everything's cruel according to you.
Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel.
Pulling on his tail is cruel.
Yelling in his ears is cruel.
Everything is cruel.
So excuse me if I'm cruel! [ Yells .]

He needs plants to live.
Plants, eh? [ Squirrels Chittering .]
Strip the bark now, Stampy.
- Hey, any more arboretums around here? - No! [ Gasps .]
That bird.
! He's killing the elephant.
! Stop him.

- Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart? Nah.
He doesn't wanna learn, and I don't wanna teach him.
We get along fine.
- [ Heavy Panting .]
- Hey, what's with them? I think they're trying to get some attention.
Oh.
Good luck! Look at these bills.
''Chain for elephant.
'' ''Shots for elephant.
'' ''Oversized decorative poncho''! Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Well, these bills will have to be paid out of your allowance.
You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1 ,000 a week.
- Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
- [ Doorbell Rings .]
- Can we see the elephant? - We'll pay you money.
For the ninth time, no! [ Doorbell Rings .]
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.
Mm, here's a better sign, Dad.
I don't have time to read it.
Just give me the gist of it, Son.
[ Playful Chattering .]
- [ Grunts .]
- Your kid flew five feet.
- That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.
- That was never five feet.
That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Yeah, well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels.
Hey, Ma, look at that pointy-hairded little girl.
[ Guffaws .]
You guys don't understand Stampy.
He's just like me.
We're a pair of jokers, and both of us are wild.
We don't take nothing from nobody.

! This reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
- [ Groaning .]
- [ Door Closes .]
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world.
Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.

Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once, right? Yes, but we paid you four dollars.
Well, that was under our old price structure.
Under our new price structure your bill comes to a total of $7 00.
Now, you've already paid me four dollars so that's just $696 more that you owe me.
Get off our property.
This town is full of deadbeats.
We can't afford this elephant.
No, Dad, he's my friend.
Sorry, Bart.
I'm gonna have to sell him.
"[''Mary Had A Little Lamb''.]
- [ Roars .]
- Well, sir, I'll be honest with ya.
I need a large African elephant, and I need it today.
But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm looking for.
What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it? Well, it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
He likes peanuts.
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant.
Thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
It's perfect, Dad.
I only have two questions: How much? And give it to me.
Well, we really can't offer you any money.
- We're a nonprofit organization.
- So, your bid is zero? - Well, we'd like to think of it as-- - Thank you.
- You know, I really think-- - Thank you.
Mr.
Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer.
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.
And I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
- [ Growling .]
We love you.
- [ Meows .]
- Mr.
Blackheart? - Yes, my pretty.
- Are you an ivory dealer? - [ Laughs .]
Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day-- whale hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network-- And, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.
Don't worry, Son.
I'll get you a new elephant.
- I'll take that one too.
- Done.
- I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
- Here's the keys.
- Elephants don't have keys.
- I'll just keep these then.
Don't worry, Stampy.
I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.
You and I are gonna run away together.
We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south.
Then, if I know my geography, it's just 1 2 miles to Africa.
Okay, bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through-- - [ Grunts .]
Stampy! - [ Trumpets .]
[ Gasps .]
Oh, it's the four elephants of the Apocalypse.
- That's horsemen, Ned.
- Well, getting closer.
Mom, Dad, Bart and Stampy are gone! Oh, my Lord! I bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
He took Bart too? That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't part! Piece of cake.
All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Oh, stupid tornado! [ Laughs .]

Many of you thought it would never happen but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.
You all thought I was mad.
Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory.
- But now, we-- - [ Trumpets .]

- Huh? - [ Panting .]

[ Woman On Speaker.]

Oh.
He's gone forever.
- [ Loud Trumpeting .]
- [ Gasps .]
Stampy! Mm.
Huh? Oh, you're lonely for other elephants, aren't you? - D'oh! - A deer! - A female deer.
Son, you're okay! And you led us to the precious ivory.
And, of course, your lovable pet, who it's connected to.
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.
Ow! Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Forget it! That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer? - I'd like it fine.
- Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys? Yes, of course I would.
Who wouldn't like that, to be part of the music scene? - Dad, you're sinking! - Huh? - Get a rope, Bart.
- No, that's okay.
I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
First, I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Now I'll pull my arms out with my face.
Mm.
[ Gurgling .]
- Dad! - Homie! Stampy, quick! Pull him out! Thanks, Stampy.
Ow! [ Gasping .]
Ah, I'm alive! I'm alive! And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Dad, feline means cat.
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.
And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.
- [ Both .]
Dad! - Oh.
I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life.
And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
- Thanks, Dad.
- On the other hand who's to say what's right these days what with all our modern ideas and products? All right.
We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.

Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm I never fathered an heir.
Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to.
- No one.

I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy.
In this phallocentric society of ours-- I don't know what ''phallocentric'' means, but no girls! So much for Plan B.
That's it, boy.
You're our last hope.
Ohh.
I just don't want to be here, Dad.
Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on.
Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea but you wouldn't have to live with Mr.
Burns.
You'd just get all of his money someday.
This could provide for your entire future.
- [ Applause .]
- Congratulations.
You've just graduated from the most expensive and, therefore, best school there is.
And your discovery of the cure for the common cold-- Hello, Marge.
I'm Lee Majors.
Will you come away with me? Uh sure.

Ooh, he card reads good.
''So pick, please, me, Mr.

- Disregard.

- Isn't there something you'd like to say? - There sure is.

- Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Yeah.
- Let's push him down the steps.
- No! You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money maybe it would be nice if you spent some time with him.
- Well-- - Come on, honey.
All right.
How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house? Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of''booger man'' but, uh, I'm really not such a bad dude.
Oh, your milk's gone cold.
I'll ring for the maid.
- Whoa! [ Muffled Grunting .]
- Oh, sorry.

- Bart, you listen! - Oh, go eat some flowers! [ Screams .]

- I want to stay here with Mr.

- As am I.
- B'oh! It's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.

'' He says-- ''D'oh.

Sorry, M.

- Huh? Oh, very well.
You can never be my-- - Eeeeeeee! - [ Gasps .]
Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass! [ Sighs .]
Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family - but those were just actors playing us.
- How do you know? Because one of them hung out with me for a week, trying to get my character down.
Yeah, me too.
That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia.

- [ All Gasp .]
- Oh, he is a gem! Here, boy.
Would you like these cookies Martin made for me? My raisin roundies! My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper.

- Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water.
- [ All .]

Great job.

, I am de-didilly-lighted to take over and I think I can put the ''pal'' back in principal.
[ All Laughing .]
Yeah, and I'll put the ''super'' back in superintendent.
[ Someone Coughs .]
It's the same exact joke.
What gives, Leo? - Now, I know everybody's eager to get back to class-- - [ Mrs.
Krabappel .]
Ha.
! but I thought it might break the ice if we had a little ''Q'' and ''A.
'' - Dude, ask a question, or we'll have to go back to class.
- Um-- - Yeah, you.
- Uh, yeah.
Uh, I was wonderin', do you, uh-- What's your policy on, uh, lunch? Well, let me just say I want to put the ''stu'' back in students.
[ All Laughing .]
It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids.
Now look what you've done, you little freaks! Young man, your gargantuan cone is making a mockery of our self-serve policy.
Bart, look.
It's Principal Skinner and I think he's gone crazy.
He's not wearing a suit or tie or anything.
Principal Skinner, um I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired and biting you and then getting it on with your leg.
Well, maybe it was for the best.
Now I-- I finally have time to do what I've always wanted-- write the great American novel.
Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques.
I call it Billy and the Clone-osaurus.
Oh, you have got to be kidding, sir.
First you think of an idea that has already been done.
Then you give it a title that nobody could possibly like.
Didn't you think this through? on the best-seller list for 1 8 months! Every magazine cover had it! most popular movies of all time, sir! What were you thinking? I mean, thank you.
Come again.
Bart, I've barely been here a-a good solid week and you've been sent to my office 1 1 times.
Now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be getting in trouble every hour.
Must have been a coincidence.
Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished.
This isn't just some sort of clubhouse.
- [ Ice Rattles .]
- Oh, sorry.
Were you drinking Slice or Yoo-hoo? Well, let's see.
''Tide.
Cheer.
''Bold.

'' I believe today I will try Bold.
Bart, how are you? How's school? Um, it's-- it's a lot of fun.
Hmm.
Well, it was good to see you.
It was? Well, then we should get together again.
Say, Saturday at my house.
Do you know where I live? Uh, no.
Hmm.
A flaming bag, eh? Well, these new Italian loafers will make short work of it.
Uh, I'm kinda busy on Saturday.
- [ Grunts, Laughs .]
- Hey! [ Chanting .]
We got Skinner's underpants! And there's nothing you can do about it, Mr.
Ex-principal.
That's not true.
I can buy a new pair.
No, I can't.
I needed those.
I really did.
Oh, you must be Seymour's friend.
He's up in his room.
Don't touch the wallpaper.

- " Ba-ba-ba-bum " " Ba-ba-ba-bum " Now a little more allegro than last time.
Bart! [ Chuckles .]
Welcome.
Can I offer you a diet caffeine-free Dr.
Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup? Uh, I'll pass.
Hey, what's this? Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam.
I was their sergeant.
They were my loyal troops.
That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back which was very strange because it was during a Bob Hope show.
I was trying to getJoey Heatherton to put on some pants, for God's sake! - Seymour,your friend Bart is here.
! - I know, Mother! - Seymour, do you want me to tell you when it's 7.
:30? - No, Mother! [ Laughing .]
Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system? [ Laughs .]
Yeah.
The teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge.
[ Both Laughing .]
Oh, that place must be falling apart.
Oh, mercy.
Nobody's mentioned me, have they? Uh, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria - but they might have been saying ''skim milk.
'' - Yeah, yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart.
They'll make a pizza pie with a topping of your choice.
- Hey, Seymour! You want your usual table? - No, no, Luigi.
I'd like one with two seats.
I'll be dining with a friend tonight.
Hey, good for you, huh? Hmm.
They treat you real nice here.
Hey, Salvatore, guess who's here! Mr.
Kookalamanza and-a some real ugly kid.
[ Students Shouting .]
This is great! Not only am I not learnin' I'm forgettin' stuff I used to know.
[ Laughs .]
And it's all thanks to you, Bart.
- Yeah, great.
- What's the matter? Don't you see, Milhouse? We've gone too far.
- We need Skinner back.
- My water dish is empty! [ School Bell Rings .]
[ Girl's Voice .]
I learned to read because of you, Principal Skinner.
[ Martin's Voice .]
Sir, I baked you these raisin roundies.
[ Ralph's Voice .]
Principal Skinner, I got carsick in your office.
[ Sobbing .]
Oh, you're Seymour's friend.
Here.
He left you this note.
[ Skinner's Voice .]
Dear Bart Your friendship during this difficult time will not be forgotten.
However, I've decided to return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life meaning-- I've reenlisted in the United States Army.
Sincerely, Sergeant Seymour Skinner.
[ Groans .]
Table for one.
Oh, you miss your friend, huh? Don't you worry.
My cooking, she'll-a cheer you up.
Hey, Salvatore, give-a the ugly kid a plate of red crap.
! It's good to have another combat veteran around here.
I myself received a number of medals for securing that Montgomery Ward in Kuwait City.
Mm, yes, Colonel.
Now, I understand it'll be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly trained infantry unit.
- Sure, I guess.
Here they come.
- [ Vehicle Approaching .]
[ Chattering .]
Hi.
Where do I get my grenades at? Uh, they don't have them group toilets here no more, do they? Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run.
Yes, deeply concerned.
Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick but that's just because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy.
Whoopsy-doodle.
Oh, man! Ned spilled ink all over my poems! He's a real flat tire.
I mean a cube, man.
He's putting us on the train to Squaresville, Mona.
Hmm? " I met a woman in Paris, France " " Had a big hole in her underpants " Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where did you pick up that filth? We heard Sergeant Clark's company singing it, sir.
Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company.
You're in this man's army to learn.
" I don't know, but I've been told " "The Parthenon is mighty old " - " How old " - "We don't know " "That's real good but needs improvement " [ Sighs .]
Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square - but there's the proof.
- It's weird, Lise.
I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy.
I think you need Skinner, Bart.
Everybody needs a nemesis.
Sherlock Holmes had his Dr.
Moriarty.
Mountain Dew has its Mello Yello.
Even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow.

[ Incoming Ordnance .]
If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to come back? Ah, I must admit I do miss the school.
Frankly, the army isn't quite as I remembered it.
Up yours, Sergeant! Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it.
I do want to come back, Bart but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired.
Oh, I think I could get him fired.
I got you fired, didn't I? [ Laughing .]
Yes.
Now, you realize if I become principal again we can no longer be friends, unless you become a good student.
Hmm.
That's probably never gonna happen.
- Well, we'll always have the Laundromat.
- Yeah.
What's he doing here? Once he found out we were gonna get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
Once he found out we were gonna get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
- That is true.
- Here's the plan.
Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten he'll fire Ned on the spot.
Uh, one question remains: How do I get out of the army? No problemo.
Just make a pass at your commanding officer.
Done and done.
And I mean done.

What's going on in there? [ All .]

Come on, Chalmie.
You fired Skinner for less than this.
Yeah, I did, but Skinner really bugged me.
Besides, the way America's public schools are sliding they'll all be this way in a few months.
I say lay back and enjoy it.
It's a hell of a toboggan ride.
[ Ned On Speaker .]
Well, cockilly-doodilly-do, little buddies.
Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day.
Thank the Lor-- Thank the Lord? That sounded like a prayer.
A prayer! A prayer in a public school! God has no place within these walls just like facts have no place within organized religion! Simpson, you get your wish.
Flanders is history.
[ Humming .]
Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent.
May the Lord bless and keep you.
- Yeah, take it outside, God boy.
- Okilly-dokilly.
Dirksen, tuck in your shirt.
Jaffee, spit out that gum.
You really think it's a good idea to give that freak his job back? Ah, he seems to know the students' names.
So, I guess we're enemies again.
I guess.
Thanks, Bart.
Sure.

They've been designed by eminent posturologists to eliminate slouching by the year 3000.

I know they seem a little uncomfortable right now.
But eventually your bones will change shape.

I've lost all feeling in the left side of my body.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, unfortunately our school clocks have been running fast all semester so today we all have to stay two extra hours to make up for the time we lost.
- Ha! - [ Groaning .]

I'm outta here.
Mrs.
Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist.
I have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework.

That's okay, Bart.

You and Willie got mixed-up about 1 0 minutes ago.
We did not! Now, where's Bart? You better tell me! Oh! You better tell him, lassie.
I cannot control him when he gets like this.

Now you're the good cop.
What? [ Sighs .]

Oh, yeah, and the waiter's been brutally beaten.

It says Freddy Quimby beat a waiter half to death.
Those Quimby children are so wild and rich.
I hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
- But Freddy Quimby's innocent! - How do you know? There weren't any witnesses.
[ Chuckles .]
Oh, yeah.
Right.
You'd think someone would've seen something at a crowded party like that.
Well, they didn't, okay? They didn't! It says so right here in black-and-white, ''no witnesses.
'' Case closed.
Now, let's all read the funnies.
Oh, look, Charlie Brown said, ''Good grief.
'' [ Chuckles .]
I didn't see that comin'.
Lisa, I gotta tell somebody.
I was at the Quimby compound yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked.
I know that Freddy Quimby is innocent.
You're a witness? Bart, you have to tell the police.
- [ Sighs .]
I can't.
- Why? - [ Brakes Squeal .]
- Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday.
And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School.
What he said.
Oh, I see.
If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school.
Well, if Freddy Quimby didn't do it I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury.
Oh,jury duty! I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this! - [ Sighs .]
- I knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.
Let's go over to the county courthouse live to Kent Brockman.
ockman,just outside the county courtroom where an argument about chowder has spilled over into the biggest trial in Springfield history.
Behind these doors, a federal judge will ladle out steaming bowls of rich, creamy justice in a case the media have dubbed ''Beat-up Waiter.
'' [ Scoffs .]
This reporter suggested ''Waitergate,'' but was shouted down at the press club.
Now, it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state Now, it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state [ Whispering .]
so we'll have to be quiet.
[ Thinking .]
I know you can read my thoughts, Bart.
Just a little reminder-- if I find out you cut class your ass is mine.
Yes, you heard me.
I think words I would never say.
I know you can read my thoughts, boy.
" Meow meow meow meow Meow meow meow meow " " Meow meow meow meow Meow meow meow meow " I intend to prove that Freddy Quimby is totally innocent.
First of all, his accuser is a very shady character.
That waiter, Mr.
LaCoste, not only wasn't born in Springfield he wasn't even born in this country! [ Gasping, Murmuring .]
- It's an exclusive.
! - From now on, you tell me everything.
Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire night in question.
We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in uh, you know, one of them loser countries.
- Well, that clears Quimby.
- He's clearly innocent.
Oh, good.
My laundry is done.
You see, Lisa? They don't need my testimony.
Only because Mayor Quimby is buying his nephew's freedom.
[ Sighs .]
The system works.
Just ask Claus von Bulow.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that Freddy Quimby is guilty but that he is also innocent of not being guilty.
I refer you to my expert witness, Dr.
Hibbert.
Well, only one in two million people has what we call the ''evil gene.
'' Hitler had it.
Walt Disney had it.
And Freddy Quimby has it.
Thank you, Dr.
Hibbert.
I rest my case.
You rest your case? What? Oh, no.
I thought that was just a figure of speech.
Case closed.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Yes, I'd like to bring something to the court's attention.
[ Snoring .]
- Huh? What? - Give those glasses to the bailiff.
All right.
- And those.
- Oh! Your Honor, even though I've proven my client's innocence I'd still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand so that we can all bask in his gentle decency.
- He's wealthy, therefore, inherently good.
- [ Woman .]
Yes, innocent.
Mr.
Quimby, did you assault Mr.
LaCoste? Of course not.
I love each and every living thing on God's green earth.
Well, therefore, you certainly would never lose your temper over something as trivial as the pronunciation of''chowder.
'' That's ''chowdah!'' ''Chowdah!'' I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! Especially those of you in the jury! - [ Gasps, Murmuring .]
- He's clearly guilty.
Wow, that didn't go well.
The defense rests.
Will the jury retire and come to its decision? [ Chuckles .]
This won't take long.
He's clearly guilty.
We'll probably be home by dinnertime.
Good.
Tonight, the dog from Frasier is gonna ride the dolphin on SeaQuest.
Well, Bart, because of you a horrible yet innocent person is going to jail.
Hmm.
Maybe I should come forward.
Oh, I can't wait till the sentencing part.
That's where I really shine.
Bart Simpson, for the heinous crime of hooky I sentence you to a lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria.
[ Raspy Voice .]
More creamed corn,JimboJr.
? This creamed corn tastes like creamed crap.
Watch the potty mouth, honey.
[ Sighs .]
Your sister says you have something to tell me.
What? Uh-- Um, yeah.
Oh, I just-- I just wanted to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench.
- Mm.
- Keep up the good work, toots.
[ Laughs .]
- [ Groans .]
- [ Chuckles .]
Chicks on the bench.
Why bother votin'? He's guilty.
Well, we might as well make it official.
- What does ''sequestered'' mean? - If the jury is deadlocked, they are put in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world.
- What does ''deadlocked'' mean? - It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
- Uh-huh.
And ''if'? - A conjunction meaning ''in the event that'' or ''on condition that.
'' So if we don't all vote the same way we'll be deadlocked and have to be sequestered in the Springfield Palace Hotel.
That's not gonna happen, Homer.
Let's vote.
My liver is failing.
Where we'll get: a free room, free food, free swimming pool free HBO-- Ooh! Free Willy.
! Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson.
It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale.
- Now let's vote.
- Uh, how are the rest of you voting? - Guilty.
- Okay, fine.
- How many S's in ''innocent''? - [ Groaning .]
I'm only doing what I think is right.
I believe Freddy Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
Oh, I miss you too, Marge.
But the law needs me.
I'll be home as soon as I can.
Room service, send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.

- Mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but I know he's innocent.
Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying ''Shoot 'em all, and let God sort 'em out.
'' Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice.
It took 7 5 federal marshals to bring him down.
Now, let's never speak of him again.

Mom? Mom! - Mom! - Hmm? What if I can get this guy off the hook? I mean, sh-should I do it? Honey, you should listen to your heart and not the voices in your head like a certain uncle did one gray December morn.

Even though reopening a trial at this point is illegal and grossly unconstitutional I just can't say no to kids.
So, young man if Freddy Quimby didn't inflict these injuries on Mr.

How could you have seen all this, Bart? Weren't you supposed to be in school? [ Inhales .]
I sorta skipped school.
I knew it! I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson! What slipup? What are you talking about? - He confessed it.
- Quiet.
I need this.
This court finds Freddy Quimby innocent of all charges.
Case dismissed.
[ Cheering .]
Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there.
You testified for the Quimby boy, even though it was putting your own head in a noose.
On the other hand, you skipped school.
I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh.
[ Sighs .]
I'm a small man in some ways, Bart.
A small, petty man.

- [ Groans .]
Wait a minute, Bart.
Make that four months detention.

Well, Marge, it was horrible.
Everyone was against me in that jury room.
But I stood by the courage of my convictions, and I prevailed.

What? It's not ''Magaggie's'' birthday? Oh.

Hello, everyone, except Homer.
Happy Birthday, Granddaughter.
Marge, I think that's your father-in-law across the street.
Happy birthday! Everybody get ready.
Here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress.
- [ All .]
Aww! - She's a little angel.
Yeah.
I wanna put a hook in her and hang her from our Christmas tree.
- What smells? - Uh-oh.
Shouldn't we wait for the other babies before we open presents? We didn't invite other babies.
Maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.

What she needs is a balsam specific.

I remember Lisa's third birthday.
She and Bart did this adorable little song and dance routine.

Hurry up! Each Matlock could be our last.
Homie, you know it's funny both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely.
[ Giggles .]
That is funny.
Yeah.
Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together or shopping or to that room in the library that's always full of old people-- Periodicals, that's it! Marge, please, old people don't need companionship.
They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet? Oh! Say, I've got a neat idea.
Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll go out to dinner? I'll be back in a jiffy! - That's not my mother.
- I'll be back in a jiffy! Can I come too? Oh.

- Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair.

But you should've seen 'em, Marge.

- Mmm.
I'm happy about that.
But I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy.
Look, Marge.
You don't know what it's like.
I'm the one out there putting his ass on the line.
And I'm not out of order.
You're out of order! The whole freakin' system is out of order.
You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge.
It's Chinatown! - Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again! - [ Quietly .]
Yes, ma'am.
Now, what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as ''the process of removing weeds from one's garden.
'' - [ All Groan .]
- Tell us more about you and Marge.
This is a place of learning, not a house of hearing about things.
- [ Students Groan .]
- Guess he's run out of stories.
- What a rip-off.
- I can't believe I paid $1 0,000 for this course.
What the heck was that lab fee for? No.
Wait.
Uh, um-- Wait.
I-- Yes.
[ Clears Throat .]
I do have a story about two other young marrieds.
[ Students Murmuring .]
Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom.
It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.
- We need names! - Well, let's just call 'em, uh Mr.
''X'' and Mrs.
''Y.
'' So, anyway, Mr.
''X'' would say, ''Marge, if this doesn't get your motor running my name isn't HomerJ.
Simpson.
'' [ All Gasping, Murmuring .]
- Huh? - Ooh, Homer, don't you have to get to class? Not tonight, Marge.
Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home.
Oh.
Well, that will be l-- [ Gasps .]
- What the darn? - Marge, you'll never guess what.
My whole class is here.
They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives.
Apparently, that disturbing odor was the food.
So, little Lisa, apple of my eye how are things down at the old schoolhouse? I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
[ Chuckling .]
And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any june bugs today? Me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer.
Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.
What the hell are you talkin' about? You're the one who double-dared us.
- Why, you little-- - [ Choking .]
- [ Class .]
Ooh.
- Homer! - I'm outta here.
- Me too.
- [ Students Murmuring Quietly .]
- [ Forced Laughing .]
Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed-- I want this to end now.
Hey, Homer.
Why don't you just nibble her elbow? That always melts her butter, right? Heh, heh, heh.
[ Gasps .]
All right.
Okay.
Everybody out! Ooh, she's gotta have it.
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out-out-out-out-out-out-out! All right, we're breaking early tonight, class.
- For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through 1 8 in Lisa's diary.
- You too.
- Get out! - But I'm not in the cla-- Is any of this gonna be on the test? 'Cause I wasn't payin' attention.
Come on, Marge.
Let me in! There's crickets out here.
Okay, Marge.
Things were said.
Mistakes were made.
Let's end this madness and get on with our lives.
You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives, even after you promised you wouldn't.
- I can't trust you anymore.
- But I learned my lesson.
- It'll never happen again.
- Hey, Homer.
What's the big brouhaha-ha? - Ah, Marge is throwin' me out for blabbin' about her elbow thing.
- [ Groans .]
Honey, the door blew shut.
Oh.
Fine.
If that's what you want, you've got it.
This scene is gettin' old, man.
I'm hittin' the road.
Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world.
Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now and I don't know what's going to happen.
But just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very, very much.
Wow, I've never seen Mom so mad at Homer before.
I'll tell you a secret, Bart.
Every time I'm worried about Mom and Dad I go to the attic and add to my ball of string.
[ Screeches .]
Earth base, this is Commander Bart McCool.
We are under attack by the Zorrinid brain changers.
Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot.
[ In Monotone .]
Affirmative, humanoid.
[ Both .]
Ew! Don't mind me, boys.
Just scrubbin' my undies.
Sorry, Bart.
Your dad kinda blew the fantasy.
I only like it when I'm pretend-scared.
Keep up the roughhousing, Son.
Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight.
Oh, these stubborn grass stains.
Oh, good.
Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back.
He has to push the sanctity of marriage, or his god will punish him.
- Get a divorce.
- Mm-hmm.
- But isn't that a sin? - Marge,just about everything is a sin.
You ever sat down and read this thing? Technically, we're not allowed to go go the bathroom.
[ Sighs .]
[ Moans Softly .]
Good night, Marge.
[ Kisses .]
Oh, why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture.
Hmm.
Funny the way everything reminds me of Homer.
[ Homer's Voice .]
I love you.
Will you marry me, Marge? You mean, I'm gonna be a daddy? I hope we'll always be together, together, together-- - Together? - [ Tires Screech .]
[ Screams, Grunting .]
Ooh.
Here, Dad.
I brought you some nice-- [ Yelps .]
Good news, Lisa.
I don't need your mother anymore.
I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.
Dad, that's just a plant.
Lisa! You will respect your new mother.
Now, give her a kiss.
Kiss her! [ Yelps .]
Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God! [ Panting .]
All right.
Let's get our stories straight.
She tripped, right? Look.
I brought you some nice pudding.
Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding.
Oh, I miss Marge.
Lisa, you're smart.
Help me trick her into taking me back.
Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you.
There's a reason two people come together and stay together.
There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them.
If you want Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.
I'll pay you $40 if you think of it for me.
- No.
- Okay.
30.
Good luck, Dad.
All right, brain.
It's all up to you.
If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.
[ Thinking, Rapidly .]
Eat the pudding.
Eat the pudding-- Eat the pudding.
Eat the pudding-- [ Continues .]
Okay, but then we gotta get to work.
[ Eating Loudly .]
[ Moans Softly .]
- [ Doorbell Chimes .]
- [ Exhales .]
[ Clears Throat .]
Oh.
H-Hi, Marge.
I heard you and Homer broke up, so I'm declarin' my intentions to move in on his territory.
- Here, I, uh, brung ya some posies.
- Oh, my.
I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested.
Sheesh.
I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like put my heart on the line, and I make a fool of myself.
Oh, boy.
Oh, I'm gonna start bawlin' here.
- Hmm, why don't you come inside for a drink of water? - 'Kay.
Hmm.
Clean house, no silverfish.
- Could've been very happy here.
- [ Knocking .]
- Homer.
- Moe.
- What are you doin' here? - I, um-- Well, I-- - I never touched her.
Homer, I swear, I never touched her.
- Here's your water, Moe.
I didn't ask her for no water.
She's lyin', Homer.
She told me you were dead.
That's the only reason I-- I didn't do nothin'! - [ Glass Breaking .]
- [ Screams .]
- Bye, Moe.
Homer, what happened to you? Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can: a bouquet of po-- ohhh.
I give up.
I don't deserve to live with you.
- Hmm.
- [ Table Bumps Against Wall .]
Oh.
My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Oh, here.
Let me help you.
[ Muttering Softy .]
Wait a minute.
Wait, that's it.
I know now what I can offer you that no one else can: complete and utter dependence.
Homer, that's not a good thing.
Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing.
Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you.
I need you to take care of me, to put up with me and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you.
[ Sad Grunt .]
But how do I know I can trust you? Marge, look at me.
We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman.
In another few hours I'll be dead.
I can't afford to lose your trust again.
- [ Sighing .]
- Oh.
I must admit.
You really do make a gal feel needed.
Wait till my class hears about this.
Kidding! [ Sighs .]
Oh, it's great to be indoors with my family.
I'm really glad you're back, Dad.
I knew you could do it.
Now don't screw it up.
Look, Dad.
I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an ''F.
'' Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
Oh.
Sorry.
Here's a fresh one.
And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight.
Special present? I don't wanna wait.
I want it now! I want the children to see.
Ooh.
Oh, right.
Later.
[ Chuckling .]
So, Marge, are you really happy? Really? - Hey, Moe.
- [ Yelps .]
- [ People Chattering .]
- Shh!
